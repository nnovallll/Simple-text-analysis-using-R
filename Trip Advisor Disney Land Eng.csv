Review
Being big fans of Disney, our family has been working our way across the globe ticking off our bucket list of visiting every Disney park on the planet.  I’d heard stories that the Disneyland in Tokyo was very crowded and we wouldn’t get many rides however that turned out not to be the case.  We turned up about 9am which is quite late for the Japanese who tend to get there on opening but even then we ticked off Pirates of the Caribbean and Jungle Cruise in the first half hour.  Both had wait times of 5-10 minutes.  It started getting more crowded as the day wore on but not as crazy as Disneyland in Anaheim which we visited last year.  As per my title it gets real hot real quick and we were really sweating by mid morning.  We are staying at Disneyland hotel next door which made it real convenient to nip back to the hotel mid afternoon for a break before re-entering park in early evening.  I’d recommend this as trying to tackle it all in a day would be possible but would be draining.  Also book a couple of table service restaurants well in advance giving you the chance to sit down in the AC.
The park is well-managed in terms of queue and cleanliness. like all theme parks, there’s bound to always be a crowd but you don’t really feel it there because it’s so organised. the food is good too! we thoroughly enjoyed our time here.
"We have visited Disneyland and Disney World in the USA and enjoyed seeing the differences at Tokyo Disneyland.  The prices for food was much lower than in the US parks.  The merchandise is mostly geared towards characters.  We wanted shirts, mugs, etc with ""Tokyo Disneyland"" on them, but could only find one shirt. That was a bit disappointing, but they did have some different wearable ears.  The Main Street is covered, so that was nice."
This has all the rides it seems from Peter Pan, Whinny the Pooh (much better then Florida), Monsters,Inc. and too many to list. Its a great park. The electric parade (similar to the 1970's florida parade is the best I have ever seen in any Disney Park. The water Show at the castle willl cool you off is you stand in the front areas. Fun Fun Fun.
Japan Disneyland Disneyland Disneyland Well , where shall I start ?  Let see .Before anyone ever visit this so called magical place , is like almost every single person child hood that need to fulfill in some point of our life .This so called theme park isn’t really a theme park but rather more of a pay money to enjoy been tortured . ( if you like been tortured by using money , this will be your best solution ) The entrance fee isn’t the only fee that you be paying . There is other plus plus involved inside it . ( leeching more money off you ) Almost each so called theme that you going in , you need to wait at least 45min ( none peak season ) and it nothing you can play , rather more like a sight seeing or watching old Disney cartoon . Don’t see much Disney character walking around the theme park ( maybe cause that moment I am there , is raining )No firework during summer  No special season ticket after 3pm ! ( I think this special ticket only for winter season ) Even the most iconic character of all time is hiding inside his house aka Mickey house , just to leech you more money ( to take photo with Mickey , you need to pay him royalty fee  ) or you can only have 1 photo using your camera . ( how bad is that ? , I came all the way from another country because of you Mickey , and you wan more money just to have photo with you !!! That a pathetic move from Disney ! ( thanks Disney but no thanks ) Some theme isn’t even available and we still get charge full price for our entrance . ( I am not a stingy person but this type of greedy business system is what put people off ) . Anyhow , my conclusion for this , do it once and don’t do it anymore , not worth the time waiting for each theme just for sightseeing . ( there are plenty more of other way to make you feel better ) BUT on the other hand , you still need to fulfill your childhood  😂Forgot to mention - don’t listen to those blogger online ( their opinion sometimes doesn’t match the idealist of yours )
We visited with a group of 8 people aged from 8 to 70 and we all had a fabulous time. We were there on a Tuesday in April and there were only a few things that had excessive long wait times - mainly the roller coasters and more popular rides. With no interest in roller coasters, we were able to go on most of our choices without waiting more than around 10 minutes. The special event Easter parade was excellent. We had lunch at Tomorrowland Terrace, which offers a good range of fast food options including fries, Mickey shaped chicken nuggets and Mickey shaped burgers. We also had a delicious peach cake which came with a limited edition Disney Easter souvenir plate. We had dinner at the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall which is a counter-service buffeteria-style restaurant. We lined up for around 30 minutes but the food was excellent and worth the wait. The unbirthday cake was particularly delicious and easily served 4 to 6 people. Unfortunately the fireworks were cancelled the night we were there due to unsatisfactory weather conditions, which was disappointing.
It was a great happy place in-spite of  the heat... rides are great shows are nice even if almost everything is in Japanese , you will enjoy watching .
Really fun place great for kids - stayed at the amazing Sheraton Tokyo bay. Very clean and well maintained theme park.
I wanted to visit Disneyland since i was a child. Dream finally came true, and it did not disappoint. I wish there were more luxury choices for lunch though. I will take my children here certainly.
I love Disneylands and this was my fifth.  They're all similarly laid out so if you know your Disney, you won't have a problem finding your way around.  It was lesser populous than Disney Sea but I think it a much better park.  Vast, so good walking shoes are necessary but much to see in between walking and/or queueing for rides.  Any Disneyland is a must and this one is no exception.  There was no language barrier with those staff who don't speak English carrying a phrase book to help with communication.
The three of us went during the first week of July and had a wonderful time. We went on weekdays but it was still crowded. It was also rainy but that didn't keep people away. There were still lines for the more popular rides but the fast pass system helps to eleviate this so that you're not queuing all day. There are more things to do in the park than just the rides, anyway. It's a very clean park and the cast members are lovely and helpful. Most speak some English although it was difficult sometimes when you are asking about something specific. But they have created a Disneyland that has many of the same atmospheres of the original in California. It is not as big but it is expanding.The parades are great. Be sure to secure a spot 45 minutes beforehand. People sit on mats and are very orderly for the most part. Cast members constantly come around to make sure everything is orderly and no one is breaking the rules. No hats, strollers must be folded, and you cannot stand in front of people. No kids on shoulders, either. The food and merchandise are varied and not too pricey, especially compared to other parks. The green man mochi and flavoured popcorn are must tries. The main criticism I have is character greetings. If you have a little girl who dreams of meeting Disney princesses, and that is the main reason you are coming, then there is a good chance that you will leave heartbroken and your little girl will be in tears. You have to be very very lucky. First of all, not all the princesses are here. Snow White, Cinderella, Belle and Rapunzel are the only ones you can meet (Ariel and Jasmine are at Disneysea). During a normal day, they are only available for meet and greets for a total of 15 minutes. After asking around we were finally able to find out where they would be. Once seen, a mob of 20-somethings will circle them, hoping to get chosen (there are no lines for this) by the princess, no doubt for their instagram pages. Luckily the princesses know this, and mostly choose children (dress your girls up in princess outfits to heighten your chances). My young girl (she's 5) was chosen by Rapunzel and Belle for photos (both princesses were very kind to my daughter). By the time we ran over to Snow White, it was all over. She gave my daughter a hug while I took a few fast photos, but that was it. 15 minutes and they are rushing back to get ready for the next parade. My daughter was very very lucky - most are not and I saw numerous people in tears. I don't know why Disneyland lets this happen. At Disneysea, Ariel is in her grotto all day, available for photos. Likewise, in Anaheim, princesses are available in the Fantasy Faire Royal Hall all day, and many of them are wandering around, available for meet and greets. This is the only big flaw in this park. Otherwise, it's a great place!
It is mostly like the other Disney parks.  Make sure to ride the Pooh ride (different than Anaheim).  Try the different flavors of popcorn also.  Service inside the park is outstanding - combination of Disney and Japanese hospitality.  Get there when it opens and ride the popular rides.  The park gets crowded after about 2 hours until closing.
I hadn’t been to Disneyland before so was really looking forward to experiencing my first trip to one. We went on a weekday as advised as it’s meant to be quiet and it was horrendously busy felt like there were far too many people in the park, even to get a drink from a vending machine you were looking at 12 people in a queue throughout the day. The fast track pass was a joke as most of them had sold out extremely early. We managed to get one which was the buzz light year ride. We queued for 90 mins for the Winnie the Pooh ride which was over in 90 seconds and felt like a waste of time. The whole day there we managed 4 rides.Then the parades the daylight one we were told to sit down and i couldn’t see a thing and then for the night time display found a good spot to stand and was told to move on by a staff member only to be told by another staff member to go back and pretty much advised to stand where view was blocked by bushes - poor organising. The fireworks were amazing at the end and the graphics on the castle, some of the souvenirs were nice and the food although overpriced was tasty.Did feel we wasted a day of our two week trip to Japan where we could have done something more fulfilling instead of constant queuing all the time, it has put me off going to any other Disneylands.
"The whole world says to come on a weekday as it will be less crowded. Says who? it was super crowded. Lots & lots of people had already queued long before the gates opened. I saw many had brought their own picnic mats. But hey! It is winter & that thin flimsy piece of cloth is not going to keep your butt warm. Bring a portable stool please. Speaking of long queue, the waiting time to see Mickey Mouse was a staggering 90 minutes! Heck, I did not do it. Spend 90 minutes just to have a few photos taken with MM which will probably take less than 30 seconds?Souvenirs were super expensive. A packet of soft candies cost 1,200 yen. Gulp! A rice ladle cost $16 SGD & a MM hair band costs SGD $20! (I cannot remember the exact yen). I was constantly converting yen to SGD on my hand phone, gasping at just how expensive everything was. If TDL kept increasing the price of admission tickets to boost its coffers, I would not be surprised if they did the same to its souvenirs.Food wise, there was a rather limited selection no matter which restaurant you went to. And yes, all were expensive & taste lacklustre. I bought light refreshment from Daiei Supermarket to consume while queuing for the ride as apparently, eating while waiting as allowed, & I overheard a Japanese mother comment to her husband ""When are they going to stop eating?"" All right. So did she think I do not understand Japanese? I could have retaliate back but I decided to pretend I did not understand anything as I did not want to get angry & spoil my holiday mood."
Tokyo Disney is spacious and follows the Disneyland formula but with - dare I say it - a much better castle than Anaheim.  Many rides are the same as Anaheim but be aware - Space Mountain: anyone over 6 foot will struggle to ride this = tiny!!!The staff are super friendly and you’ll have a great day.  Shopping and food choices are not as good as Anaheim, but still a lovely day out.  Easily accessed via Mahaima Railway Station.
Enjoyed both parks. Many things are different than you get in the US.  They do not have park hoppers for one day visitors unless you stay in their hotel (or do a 3 day pass) so we spent the day at Disney Sea and then after 6pm, bought the evening pass for Disney Tokyo for $40 each to enjoy that park until closing at 10.
Definitely love Disney Tokyo , We bought tickets a week in advance we were in line at 8am park opens 9am did 4 rides by 11am. I recommend eating early lunch to avoid crowds in the restaurants. Queen of Hearts by its a small world has great food. No wait at 11am.
Disneyland Tokyo is good as it is spacious and the staff is very courteous and friendly despite the lack of English. Most of the rides are for younger kids and the same as the other Disneyland around the world (most rides also in HK), but it is still a good visit for first time park goers. I prefer Disney Sea more as the park is bigger and has more thrill rides and performance. The few shows and rides worth seeing/ riding in Disneyland Tokyo are: Star Tours, Space Mountain, Stitch Encounter, Buzz Lightyear, and Mickey’s PhilharMagic.Overall, more a park for kids or families rather than adults. More on DisneySea on another review.
We left getting our tickets quite late and we were visiting when it was the extended bank holiday so I'd say but them in plenty of time and buy them online. We saw people queuing to buy tickets and you risk not even getting in the park. I'm not sure how busy this Disneyland is usually but I would recommend getting here for when it opens and getting a fast pass for space mountain. We did this and found we were able to get on another ride before our fast pass time. The fast passes sell out really quickly so it's worth it to get here early. Food wise, the Mickey waffle from The Great American Waffle Company in World Bazaar and Mickey glove sandwich (we got ours at Plazma Ray's diner in Tomorrowland) are absolute musts. Both were delicious. There's a good variety of foods and snacks to try in Tokyo.
a day is not enough to see,very beautiful place و Very attractive and spectacular, and my daughter enjoyed the games.A great place for the whole day with the family or single .after games there is a shop related to the game like hat,shirts and...,there are restaurant and fast food,there is street performance show durig a day.most of the game designed by robot and computer effects and seems very real and can see Cartoon characters every where.you can find water for drink in this area free from the tap water , I can not forget it.you can reach here by train ,the station is about 10min a way. its open from 10am to 10:pm and the price was 7500 yen for adult include all games.do not miss it.
Disneyland is always something to experience, a childhood delight. Unfortunately, there are VERY little opportunities for you to see the characters up close. Definitely not like in the promo. The Disney princesses are mostly in the parade only and a few of mickey’s entourage roam the park for a small amount of time. If you’re expecting characters to be everywhere they won’t. (This is my third time with the same experience, years apart)
On a two week trip to Japan, my husband and I decided to hit Tokyo Disney for two days...being the Disney fans we are. We booked a two day Passport ticket and visited Tokyo Disneyland first. The park was very similar to WDW, just smaller and about half the attractions.  They are also missing the immaculate and lush landscaping of WDW but I think that is due to the difference in climate. The park is clean and the staff are both warm and amazing, even with the language barrier.  We left not feeling the magic of Disney we are used to but were excited to go to the Disneysea Park on our second day. It did not disappoint!!!! Disneysea is 200% magical, opulent with extremely detailed and wonderful lands to discover!! Similar in size and feel of Epcot. We could have spent two full days there, maybe three!  One thing about Japan Disney is their love and affection for Duffy the Bear. He is the bear Mickey gave Minnie, and if you’re a fan of Duffy, this is your spot as he has his own stores with tons of adorable merchandise! Our favorite attractions were by far: Indiana Jones, Journey to the Center of Earth and Tower of Terror but all of the rides were delightful and exciting. Try all of the popcorn flavors and make sure to get the shrimp donut/pasty food item which is near the American coastline area. Delish!!Disneysea was extremely busy and the wait times were longer than Disneyland as it’s the more superior park. All in all we loved Tokyo Disney parks and had a wonderful time!!
*** remember to print out your tickets!! ***you are issued electronic PDF tickets and like 99% of theme parks i’ve been all over the world, you can use the bar or QR code on the PDF in your phone. but for some reason, the staff insists on using a printout which is archaic to the point of insanity. i showed the turnstile girl that the turnstile will accept the QR code displayed from my phone but she insisted i use paper tickets which meant on the first day i had to walk all the way to an office tucked in a small corner with one very slow computer to print out the tickets. i don’t get why the QR code has to be shown on a printed ticket as opposed to the phone and don’t give me an excuse one or the other is easier to falsify because they both can be falsified if one wants to try. totally unreasonable. if you lived in a hotel apartment like i did with no access to a printer, you will be slightly screwed. otherwise... the theme park was awesome!
We went here early morning around 9 am from Hilton Tokyo bay free bus to bay station they you have the monorail to Disney land we stop to buy tickets for the monorail for 2 days at station while the tickets of Disney land for 2 days (2adult+3kids+free for kid below 4years)= to 55200 yenThe entrance was so nice and smooth and the waiting time was 20 minutes then after noon increased to 50 minutes but still my kids have chance to play most of big games They have many cafe and restaurants but we decided to have our dinner at the hotel while it served for free and we have nice ice cream and curry popcorn was tasty and delicious We spent amazing time and my daughters visited the castle and set of the princess chair and have unforgettable moments The shows was very crowded and exciting
This year Tokyo Disneyland celebrates 35 years since it opened. I was one of their first visitors and have visited it many, many times during those 35 years. July 5th I visited again with my family for a long deserved day out. Most of the day was very enjoyable, until we went to Big Thunder Mountain at 9:45 pm. Four members of my family had Fast Passes, I did not, but I obtained a “Single Rider” pass so that we could all get in together. However, just as we were about to board a very unsympathetic and rude Attendant, a girl, refused to let me board with my family and separated us. I was forced to stand and wait with another “Single Rider,” who was Japanese. I felt I was being punished for a misdemeanour and was not treated according to the usual Japanese “The Customer is Number 1” or “The Customer is God” philosophy. I was bitterly hurt and disappointed, then faced being forced to wait until my family disappeared on the Ride and I was still waiting to board. I asked another Attendant. Another train came and went before I approached the second Attendant. She asked me to go to the back of the next train and join another customer. I decided that the fun had been taken away from me and indeed the entire day was ruined for me and my family because of this horrible experience. I asked to be shown the exit because I no longer wanted to go on the Ride. Both inside and outside I complained to other Staff and one of them walked behind my daughter and I and constantly apologised. I told him it was really too late and I was very hurt.  The first Attendant was the most cold hearted person I have ever met in Tokyo Disneyland, and if she treats other customers like she treated me, a 70 year old, then she really should not be working there. I hope that other customers do not experience the cold hearted rudeness I was subjected to. I intend contacting Customer Services, which seems inaccessible, to further complain. By the way, I’m a fluent Japanese speaker, and all my communications with the Staff were in Japanese.
I am a Disney girl. I have been to many different parks all around the world but something is going wrong. The park is incredibly clean, the staff are wonderful and the rides and attractions are just like the original park in LA. There is magic here BUT it is so incredibly packed that the magic turns to grumpiness because you have to line up for everything. It's ok if you wait for 30 mins.....but over 90 mins for a 2 minute ride is stretching the enjoyment level. Fast Passes and increased crowd volume are ruining the parks. There are just not enough attractions or rides for the volume of people. When you live in the same state/country as a Disney park you have the opportunity to buy an annual pass, so if you go on a busy day and only see 1 or 2 things, it's ok...you can come back. When you pay heaps of money to.fly your family to a Disney, pay for passes and accommodation, it is a major disappointment to stand in line for hours. When I look at the statue of Walt Disney at the park, I wonder if this was the vision he had in mind?
If you want a magical adventure - this is the place to be. The attractions are inch-perfect with smart solutions for the queuesystem(use the fastpass if possible). Everyone was so friendly and in character and it was so nice seeing people dressing the same as friends, family, couple etc - gave it a more Disneyfeeling. Their stores are amazingly good also.
First day we went to Disney Sea and the second day to Disneyland.  Although it rained pretty much the entire day it was still a great experience! Loved the different sections, seeing the castle was awesome too. We had missed the fireworks show so we went back the day after to watch it. They have afternoon tickets you can get for about 5400 yen. Next time we go I'm buying more snacks to bring home!
Awesome few days at Tokyo Disneyland. The queues can get long so make the most of the fast pass system. Most the day time and night time parades were amazing but the night time fireworks were lack luster but still good.
This was my second visit to a Disney park, and much like Euro Disney it did not disappoint. I was expecting massive crowds and long lines, but that was not the case, no more then any other Disney park in any case. Clean and tidy with reasonably priced food etc. Well worth a visit, and if you are going then you need to visit Tokyo Disney Sea as well !!!
The park was as expected from other Disneyland’s. Not as many opportunities for character photos and the merchandise did not have a large range. Absolutely wonderful staff though who are so friendly and helpful!
My wife and I spent a fantastic day and night in Disneyland and found it so good staff were very helpful,lots of places to eat,drink and after paying for a day pass all the rides were free,but be ready to queue,very large crowds but don’t let that put you off,we spent over 10 hours there and could have stayed more,enjoy.
Not the best Disney around half the rides were closed for maintenance including splash mountain. If you do go go early! Big rush for space mountain and big queues form at the gates. If you’re English speaking avoid the shows as they’re in Japanese and it’ll be a waste of your time
Wonderful parc and amazing moments spent.We went with our child, she was so amazed... ans happy.We stayed 1 full day... it s free form kids below 3y.1 day was enough for us... we could enjoyed a lot of attractions and the queue line was not very long. Once again we went during a week day, with no holiday.Last thing important, try to get tickets on line, 7 days before or buy tickets into the Disney store. Better...
This will be my 4th Disneyland Park I have visited. All-in-all it was a good experience, the magic of Disney is everywhere. However it is much, much busier than other ‘western’ parks. Queue times will be almost 2 hours within minutes if the park opening. Fast Passes are therefore key if you plan to do anything more than a. Few rides. This park is obviously primarily aimed at children. The rides are largely based around the children’s films. For a more adult experience with larger rides you should consider visiting DisneySea just across the bay.
Overwhelmed by the huge number of parkgoers during park entrance at around 8:30am. Fast Pass is the key!
Before coming to Tokyo Disneyland we had only been to the parks in Florida before. Being at TDR was like being in an alternate reality. There were so many things that were the same, but had slightly different twists. Overall, we found the rides to be less thrilling than at Magic Kingdom. The snacks are really fun to try and the merch is amazing compared to in the states! Our favorite rides were Pooh's Hunny Hunt and Monsters Inc. We spent two full days at the park and my favorite thing by far was the Dreamlights parade. We staked out a spot way before it started on a bench, but it didn't matter much since everyone sits in Japan (which is so much better). The parade is absolutely amazing! We weren't able to watch fireworks while we were there because they were cancelled every night (I think because of wind). We had a really fun time and can't wait for the new lands to open up!
There are many similarities to US Disney theme parks with enough differences to make it an adventure. Staff very Friendly and kind. Ride lines as you expect in summer but not overwhelming long. Not as many cast members who speak English as I expected but enough who do , picture menus and signs to allow low frustration level. Plenty of shopping in park. Popcorn containers are a novelty item in a variety of themes. Wish I had room to bring some home
If going to Disney please buy express pass if u want to do everything otherwise u r bound to miss out few things
One of the best Disney Parks in the world.  Wait times are no joke (Pooh's Hunny Hunt fastpasses are gone 90 minutes after park opening).  Get there at least 30 minutes before park opening (preferably 45-60 minutes).For Happy 15 entry, they let you in 30 minutes before, so make sure you are there 30 minutes before that.
I was visiting with a group of 30 high school students from the US, some who had and had never been to the park at home. I really enjoyed the experience overall as did the students. The entrance price was about $30 less than it is in the US and the park still uses “fast passes” to allow visitors to cut the lines a few times during their visit. Space Mountain and Thunder Mountain were the two rides with the longest lines. Splash Mountain was closed for renovations. All other rides had 45 minute predicted wait times or less. The least we saw was 20 minutes for Pirates of the Caribbean. Meal prices also weren’t bad. I had a large chicken curry and a large oolong tea for about $12 US and I purchased two bottled beverages for 200 yen each. At first I had trouble finding souvenirs that were actually connected to Japan but later found small stuffed animals of Mickey, Minnie and friends in Kimonos for about $22 US. There were also bento lunch boxes, chopsticks, towels, assorted Japanese snacks in tins and other things related to Japan. The light show was really nice though the fireworks were cancelled due to high winds. The park did make several announcements in Japanese and English alerting the crowd to the cancellation. Overall a great experience!
We arrived in Yokohama and got a train to Disney to buy tickets for the following day. The lovely guy in the ticket office was great his name was Shimozawa.He was helpful and friendly.The following day we arrived excited to be here from England, but soon found out that it was so different to Other Disney’s we have been too.The parade was over in a flash only around 6 floats and not worth the hours spent waiting for it.All the Japanese people were singing with the catchy song they were singing which was lovely although we could understand a word of it.To visitors from other countries a lot of Disney is spoken in Japanese which we were expecting bit not quite the same when given headsets to listen too.We only saw one character all day and when we went near were waved away.I’m disabled too.. I walk with a calliper and stick and like to stay out of my wheelchair when I can, but only one person, a young man who when we went to ride on the train showed me the lift and aloud me priority which was fantastic. The only person all day to do this. ( big thank you )Haunted mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean I had to stand and wait although it was plain to see this was difficult for me and due to that we had to sit out the rest of the afternoon as this was just to much for me.Love you Disney but here in Japan you didn’t care or look after me, and I can only tell as I found it.Disney Florida next year .. here we come.
Had a reeeallyy fun time but each ride has about a 40-50min waiting time, which pretty much takes up the whole day (even with the fastpasses). The best ones were The Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain! (Had really wanted to try Pooh’s Hunny Hunt and Monsters Inc but the queues were ridiculous and there simply weren’t enough time). If you only had a few days to spare in Tokyo and you’re not as patient as the typical Japanese, best visit someplace else!
So, my husband had zero interest in coming to Disneyland but did it for me and I can officially say, we will both be back. Having been to Disney in California I was a bit unsure as to whether I would like it but I absolutely loved it and maybe slightly better than California . California is prettier but the people here are so happy and lovely . We made a beeline for the Winnie the Pooh ride and my hubby loved it and wanted to go straight back on . We then went and got a fast pass for the monsters inc ride which was also good. We were lucky the lines were not long today and got in quite a few rides. The shopping was fantastic . Please , I must suggest you all have the soy and butter flavoured popcorn along with the curry flavour. Yes, it sounds gross but they are both amazinggg. My husband and I are both already planning our next trip. Can’t wait to come back again
We bought the bus tickets from Shinjuku bus station. The bus was very comfortable. Remember to be on time. We got the entrance tickets from Klook. Picking up the tickets were easy. Just pop by the Maihama station. Walk to the back of the station where the carparks are. There was a lady there with a basket on a stool. No signages though.Going back was pretty convenient though although you need to be sure where you would like to alight. Go there a little earlier as the queue can be quite long, especially when it is closing time.We've been to Hong Kong, Shanghai Disneyland previously. It looked pretty much the same although the Shanghai Disneyland seem bigger. We just love that same magical feel whenever you walk into Disneyland. The rides were abit too kiddish for my teenage son though.
I love rollercoasters! Tokyo Disneyland was a great experience. I have been there about 4 times. There is no ride you will not like. It is a family friendly park and is great for all ages. Fast passes are free just scan your ticket at the ride. But make sure you arrive early. I would recommend Tokyo Disneyland to all travellers.
We had so much fun at Tokyo Disneyland. I must admit I wasn't particularly looking forward to going to a theme park and was just doing it for the kids but honestly I had just as much fun as them.Such a great experience for families to go on rides together. Lots of laughs.We made sure we got to the park about half an hour before opening and rushed to get our first fast pass. We then enjoyed as many rides as we could. Within a couple of hours we had gone on about 5 and then got our next fast pass. It was got extremely crowded by lunch time, we went on a Monday. We noticed the next day it was not as busy as we were staying at a resort nearby. A Tuesday might be quieter. The longest queuing time was and 80 mins but the Japanese have it down to an art. The keep the lines moving so you always feel like you are getting somewhere.We were totally exhausted by the end after 14 hours of walking and queing but totally worth it.
What a fun day out, even for us oldies, park is really big, well set out, easy to get too, and lots to do.  many places to eat, things to see and do, some rides for the oldies and young ones too.   had fun.noticed how families dressed the part, dressing the same, lolgreat atmosphere
We are Florida season pass holders (so a bit biased), BUT this is by far the BEST Disney park.  The parades were incredible, the rides were fabulous!  The only thing we disliked- food and food service were sub-par.  Cast Members were great - most spoke English.  My daughter speaks Japanese, so it made for a very easy trip. We would love to go again.
heading there during winter is super peak season. the park was super crowded. hardly could take any pictures.. or rides.. even lining up for food was stressful. but still it was nice. will have to make another trip during less peak season.
My daughter and I love Disneyland . Even though it was raining it didn't stop us. Splash mountain was closed which was a shame as I love this ride . Some rides we went on were different to Anaheim Disneyland which was good . We loved thunder mountain and space mountain. Managed to do these a few times . We also loved the electrical parade and the fireworks went ahead as the rain finally stopped . We queued up at the entrance at 7am so we were close to the entrance . Disney hotel guests get in half hour before park opens . Bonus for them. I found 1day was enough for us
Timing is key. Go in the early mornings, beat the crowd and take a afternoon nap. Then go back around 4pm when its not so hot and by 7pm or so, the crowd would have thinned out.
I visit Tokyo Disneyland once to twice a year and I never get bored. The crowd levels tend to be crazy throughout the year with the attractions/rides wait time of 1-2 hours are relatively normal. However, even without going for the rides, soaking up in the atmosphere, waiting and watching for the parades, eating, and checking out the shops are still magical.The only criticism I have is the frustrating experience with the roaming characters. They should implement queue system instead of having everyone competing to be picked by the characters for photos and interaction. The characters tend to pick small children or those who dress uniquely.
We had been to Universal Studios Japan & DisneySea about 3 years ago, then Legoland Japan about a year after that... just visited Tokyo Disneyland this week.Its attractions & rides are very similar to Hong Kong Disneyland’s, if not the same. Nothing really spectacular actually. I prefer DisneySea which is quite different. If you had to choose between the two, suggest you visit DisneySea!
Its a problem in language but its nice to visit with good weather, overall its a good chance to come once, bring your kids, its nice to have a walk but try to avoid holidays or festive seasons.Enjoyment 3.5
GoodPerfect for families with toddlersWe came after the golden week so not much of queue for rides.Staff were so nice.
This area is colder compare to other places in Tokyo. It has been 35yrs and it needs renovation. The fireworks in Hongkong is better than here. Its better to try the Disney Sea because its newer.
Tokyo disneyland is a good theme park for the kids. There is a lot of attractions, food courts,Disney characters roaming around the park and the lovely parade during the day as well as in the evening. When we visited  in the 3rd week of May 2019 the fire cracker show scheduled for the evening was cancelled due to the weather conditions. The park is well maintained and kept neat and clean all the time. Maximum time we had to wait in the que was for the roller coaster ride where the waiting time was 45 minutes. Other places waiting time was around 30 minutes. The honey pop corn was very good.
This Disney park has some attractions that are different from some of their other parks so what we did was not to re do the ones we had already experienced (except a few that we love like Buzz Light Year ride)... the park is big and has almost 6 theme sub parks so going to each of them was great! Loved the experience since Disney is all about enjoying it all like a little child!   Express Pass was not necessarily helpful since all express passes have a certain time per ride that we could use. Unlike other parks where there is a separate lane for express pass holders where those can be used any time. A lovely ride! There is another park connected through mono rail called Disney Sea (about 5-7 min away) which is also a very good experience and therefore unless one knows Disney well enough covering both these in a day can be very taxing! These parks are huge and queues can be very long! That said the experience of being in Disney is always magical and we loved every bit of it !! Was super
I had been there with my friends in last summer,it was a perfect place spend your holiday,one of the best attraction to see in chiba perfecture which was near by Tokyo.We tried some of the games which makes us so much fun,mountain splash was interesting and don’t miss Disney parade.Recommended !!
If you hate crowd, do not go to disneyland. I went to Osaka Universal Studio, & the crowd were so much better than here. The number of visitors are just overwhelming. The rides are 80%for kids up to 8years old (who finds it fun). Teenagers should go to DisneySea. Line up for pretty much everything, whether it’s rides, foods, snacks or even vending machines! Lining up for rides takes 60-70mins per ride!They also love to ‘tag’ place (alongside the pavement) to watch the carnival.
We came to Tokyo for the Disney Sea as this has more variation to other Disney parks. But whilst here we got a day here too. You choose your day when you buy tickets and can not hop between parks. As such you don’t get people leaving early as they have multiple day passes or because they’re heading to the other park to see a show or fireworks. Crowd calendar said Wednesday would be quite but it wasn’t. We had the same poor selection of food as at Disney Sea and queues were long. Again everything is in Japanese and very few people can speak more than a word in English. For a big organisation like Disney I’d expect part of the job description to be able to get by in English. Most countries that have their own language speak English as the second language so would be able to get by better. The only attraction that offered us a kind of tablet with a translation on was the tiki rooms. I don’t think there was anything unique about this park which is a shame as it would have been nice to have some Japanese themed rides and section. Easter here seems to last 3 months and they have all the major characters done like an Easter egg which makes for nice photos if nothing else.
It is the very worst theme park that I had ever been. All coasters for kids were closed.  As a result, other attractions were too crowded. The waiting time is over 40mins. Furthermore, one of the shows do not allow us to enter and the stuff told us that it is because you are unlucky.  I cannot understand how could this happen in Disneyland. I believe this terrible experience is because of the poor management of the park.  There is no way that so many coasters are closed and only allow whose are “lucky” to watch the show.
An excellent place for kids and grown up as it makes everyone feel young at heart! The rides are amazing and so is the staff! Must watch - Disney parade at night (a million lights) at 7:30 pm!
I am only providing a good review because it is unfair to rate it bad due to the amount of people. Also there are some attractions that are only for Japanese. The rides are also very mild compare only to Alton towers (UK). The food queue line is also extremely long. One thing I would really comment on is that Japanese people are very polite and the weather is nice. Their queues are very organised and you don't have people attempting to cut the line.There is also a fair amount of events and happenings ( disney characters) coming out to take pictures with children. Most of them do really look like the characters in Disney and that is an amazing makeup skill.
Took the teenage grandkids to Disneyland, a first for them and me.....Everything is very slick and totally what you'd expect from Disneyland but.........After about an hour I realised it was a business not a magical place, maybe this was my Easter Bunny moment...We were there mid week so the number of people wasn't overwhelming yet we waited 25-40 minutes for each attraction, fastpass or not, and once in the attraction it was over in 5-10 minutes....Part of the park was closed so we didn't get a chance to line up for Splash Mountain...I looked and looked for Mickey Mouse, I was hoping to see him roaming the streets and eventually found his house, there was a 50 minute wait to see him so I gave that a miss...We arrived soon after opening and stayed till after the evening light parade. Food and drinks were about double the cost of fast food outside the Park and very limited menu selections, didn't find any vegetarian main meals...The staff were all excellent and we took the train to Maihama Station which ran very frequently and put us within a 10 minute walk to the Park Gates.....
I wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland/DisneySea ever since I first heard about them.(Only Shanghai left to do now 😀).The queues are huge ( not as bad as DisneySea) but  I had been on most of the rides elsewhere it didn't really matter, and the shows are in Japanese so we didn't go to them.We got there early and stayed all day, the afternoon parade was fun, the night parade is fantastic. And this is the disney castle you can go inside.The atmosphere is pure Disney what's not to love?
A truly immersive experience! We went mid-week and the crowds can be borderline overwhelming (the place is just swarming with people) but one could still manage to get in a decent number of rides (with two pre-schoolers and two senior citizens in tow) while soaking in the atmosphere and enjoying the parades. Truly a magical experience!
I grew up in SoCal going to Disney—been to Orlando and Paris as well.  And this was great too.  You have to go mid week to avoid the worst crowds.  I’m really glad I went again even though I’m over 50!
When it comes to Disney parks you're going to get more of the same here, the only disappointing thing is if you want to ride the popular rides you need to be there for rope drop to get paper fast passes as they dont have an app based version (like Disney world)The app they do have is workable however its only available in Japanese if you've been to Disney before it follows the same basic ride location. The park itself is very clean and immaculate throughout, well worth a trip.
Of course, Disneyland is the Happiest Place on Earth, and Japan has it along with Disneysea at Maihama. Easily accessible from the airports and train stations. Take the rides or just walk along the park! Enjoy!!!
We have been to Disney in California and Florida several times and this park offered nothing really different or spectacular. At times you felt you were at any Disney park and not in Tokyo
Easy to get to by train. We bought tickets there, as the only online ticket options required us to print it out (universal studios in osaka can scan a mobile voucher why cant disneyland?). Luckily the line wasnt very long to buy tickets. We ended up getting there about 9.30 (opening was 9am that day).We had heard how busy it can be, and made sure to time our visit on a weekday to avoid the bigger crowds. There were still large crowds but the lines were all pretty manageable. We managed to get a few fast passes for some of the longer waits so we could go do other things. Despite reading warnings about how early the fast passes run out, we managed to get one last one for space mountain at about 6pm (for 9pm). I guess it was a quieter day and less people were using them.Its all in Japanese of course, so we focused on the rides rather than the shows. They are all mostly aimed at the younger crowd, space mountain was about as thrill seeking as it got. If you want the bigger rollercoasters etc universal studios in osaka is much better.We still had a fabulous time and managed to pretty much do all the rides we wanted (and a few twice). Plenty to entertain for all ages. Food was as usual expensive as per theme parks, and not particularly impressive (we didnt go to any of the fancier sit down restaurants so cant comment on them). The night parade was just spectacular (if you arent interested in the parades be warned they have to close off the street so you may get stuck on the wrong side trying to get to a ride for a little while).Didnt get a chance to come here last time I was in Japan but it was a fantastic day and I’m so glad I got to go this time.
The experience and music was very uplifting and magical, giving a very happy mood! The crowd was not too bad as well as we went on a weekday! The night parade was definitely worth staying for!
A very pleasant place where magic surrounds the lands. Cutest/best in the world Disney merchandise can be found here. Great traditional rides. Fun for all the family.
Arrived at Disneyland entrance about 8.30am and it was already crowded with people. Manage to get into disneyland at about 9.30am as there was security check before entering. Make sure you check the park opening hours before your visit.Strollers are available for rental at a fee. There are plenty of stroller parks outside of each ride.As it was my first visit, I did not know how the fast pass work and only realised almost towards end of my visit after googling online. I tried asking the staff near the fast pass machine but non of us understand each other as she spoke japanese and i speak english.The fast pass is free for all visitors. You will need to go to the fast pass machine for those popular rides and scan your admission ticket. A tag with the allocated time for your ride will be issued. You can then go for other rides while you wait for the allocated time to visit the ride that you took the fast pass. Hope this info helps. The rides are fun but some have height restriction. Stay for the night parade as the night comes alive with the neon lights. I waited for the fireworks but 5 mins before they announced that the show is cancelled due to 'bad' weather??? ( But I can see the moon!). The biggest disappointment.
It’s Disneyland but with a Japanese twist - and we loved it! We had a great day out. Some really great rides, friendly staff, good layout and great fun. Parade was very good.I’d recommend arriving early even if you’ve booked tickets because the queue to get in is huge, even on quiet days.
"How does one rate Disneyland? Put it simply, it’s Disneyland period. It is where magic, and all things wonderful and happy lives. No matter how old or young; how many times; or how many Disneyland one has visited, nothing matters once you get there.To be honest, I have never been to one myself and so the first time is always going to be unique and I haven’t got the luxury to compare to others in the world. But what I can say about Tokyo Disneyland is that it is extremely well organised and especially with crowd, they are also well managed. Whilst every review and advise is to get to the park early, and to get to the fast passes, I personally think one can go there at a reasonable hour and agree that fast passes should be obtained as soon as possible but one may find themselves lucky to get in line and move along nicely. There may be a slight wait, but often than not, it is not a massive long wait. The only turn off is the fact that most rides or featured display are stated in Japanese. Understandably that it is Disneyland in Japan, and the language of the country should be respected, but for visitors, it lost a bit of the thrill when they can’t understand a word. The parades in the day and night is also magnificent. The night ones is an awesome display of colours and lights. Food in the park varies from proper restaurant to the larger fast food type. In my opinion, the fast food option isn’t as worth the money as if you go to one of the restaurants. And these restaurants can be pre-reserved so it is highly recommend that when you first enter the park, check the map and decide on one so that you can make that booking at your preferred time."
Very unorganised Disney park.confusing.very crowded.each ride takes 2 hours.no one guides u on the fast passes.a tip u can go to any machine and get fast pass which is very important for rides.or else ur visit to park will be disastrous.
This was something we decided to do because we had a spare day in Tokyo and we were so pleased that we did. It was easy to get to, the queues were virtually non existent and the Fastpass system in place allows you to skip a queue if there is one. The merchandise was a bit pricey but not having been to Disney in America or Paris I have nothing to compare this with. They put a huge amount of energy into the parades and nothing is too much trouble.
Less unique than DisneySea, Tokyo Disneyland is really just another Disneyland but this is great for children who love all Disneys. The Small world has cuter touches than HK and Paris. We beelined for the monsters inc. fast pass and got in line for Winnie the Pooh which is also more unique in Tokyo. Other than that, the shows are in japanese so we skipped but enjoyed getting on familiar rides.
My partner and I went to visit Disneyland and Disney SEA. I had researched the park and had heard quite good things about it. Many said they had some of the best rides and parades they’ve ever seen. I had also heard about many rare character opportunities. I am an ex-Cast Member of WDW and have also been to Disneyland. My partner has visited WDW, Disneyland (CA), Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Paris. I also speak a little bit of Japanese. Enough to get me by. So I’d say we’re pretty qualified to an opinion on this park.With high hopes we arrived at the monorail station. We were surprised that you had to pay money to hop on the monorail as the monorail is free at other parks. The signage wasn’t very clear but we made our way to Disney SEA on the first day. The park was over crowded. We entered at park open and the lines were already at 3 hours. WDW’s Pandora lines are nothing compared to these lines!The only park maps at the entrance are in Japanese. We didn’t find out until the end of the day that you had to REALLY LOOK for the maps that were in other languages. Whereas in WDW maps in 7 different languages are right in front of you when you enter the park.We lined up for an hour at the Raging Spirits ride in hopes that the fast pass line would die down so that we could secure one. We managed to secure one at 12:45pm so we were pretty happy with that. However we were disappointed to find out that we had to wait 2 hours until we could get our next fast pass (meaning they would probably all run out).And surprise surprise. We checked on a website (because foreigners can’t use the Tokyo Disney app) all the fast passes had run out. Except for Tower of Terror! We ran there and tried to scan our fast passes. They said we had to wait 3 minutes until we could get one and told us to wait to the side. Then they let a bunch of people in and they took the remaining fast passes and they closed the kiosk within 30 seconds.We went on the Raging Spirits ride and it was quite a disappointment. Not a lot of theming and quite a low thrill level (despite being advertised as a thrill ride). At this point we hadn’t seen any characters, lines for food and toilets were half an hour long and the ride lines were even longer. We lined up for 3 hrs and 15 minutes for Journey to the Centre. Was a fantastic ride and would say it was the best experience we had so far.As we decided to leave, we saw three of the Aristocats characters. But they were swarmed with people (apparently lines for pop up characters aren’t a thing). We also popped into a store and bought some Duffy merch. We held off on some of our purchases as we thought there’d be more in the main park (we had seen people with other merch that wasn’t in the stores). To our dismay, there was no way to know that Duffy merch was only available in Disney SEA. We only discovered that once we went to Disneyland the next day.When we went to Disneyland we thought we were much more prepared after experiencing the disappointment that was Disney SEA. Disneyland was a much smaller version of Disneyland CA or Magic Kingdom. The layout was similar, but a little different in some ways. At this park we only managed to ride Star Tours and watch the half Japanese and half English Country Bear Jamboree (which we really appreciate the addition of English!). But alas it had the same issues. Ridiculous lines, rude people and no English whatsoever. The one redeeming factor was that they had rare characters at the entrance at all times. But the way they did it was VERY strange. Face characters had lines. However fur characters had swarms of people. No lines. And you had to wait for the character to pick you for a photo. Which was an issue because you’d have people pushing you backwards trying to yell at the character for their attention. I went to get a photo with Eeyore and thankfully it didn’t take too long for me to get chosen! I went in for a hug and I guess Eeyore didn’t feel like hugs that day (I don’t think hugging is big in Japan). I didn’t let that bother me as I understand there can be cultural differences. However there was no character interaction whatsoever. Even when I spoke in Japanese.I ended up meeting Clarice later on. She was much more welcoming, however it took about half an hour to get a photo as parents would push their children at her feet, almost tripping her over! As an ex-entertainment CM I was shocked that the character attendants did NOTHING to stop this.It was quite the disappointment. Normally my partner and I are at parks from open until close. However we ended up leaving early on both days as it was just far too hectic. Want shorter lines? Visit Disneyland CA on New Years Eve. Will be half the craziness!Would 100% recommend skipping Tokyo Disney. Go to Disneyland CA or WDW instead.
We visit Disneyland every time we come to japan from when our children were 8 months til our most recent trip where they are now 7, Disneyland has a great range of rides and attractions to suit different ages. Take your own lunch and buy snacks from the endless popcorn vendors or other snack carts. Lots of opportunity to meet Disney characters but lines tend to be long and we skip these, preferring to get onto rides. Make good use of fast pass ticketing to avoid very long queues on popular rides.
We went as a family of 4 (parents with 1 schooler and toddler), went during what was considered low season (7-9 May, Tue-Thu) and enjoyed pretty much 1.5 days in Disneyland (we bought 3-days magicpass and park hop on the third day).Even during a low season, queues can vary from 5-90 min. We were considered lucky and managed to take a few rides with waiting time below 15 min. Nevertheless, we skipped those thrill rides since we were with the young kids.Plan well, read all the blogs and guides you can find online (we did spent quite significant time on this) if you want to enjoy the themepark with less fuss. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the facility was clean, plenty of benches all over the park. As a parent, I would advise bringing a picnic mat or a light portable stool (we saw locals doing that), so one may sit in queue, rest on the ground while waiting for the parade or show.May can still be chilly by the evening so do bring jumpers or wind-breakers.Can't say enough about reading more and planning well - otherwise, one can easily waste an entire day and not achieving much.
"Tokyo Disneyland is like the ""Greatest Hits"" Disneyland. It has all the best classic Disneyland rides from other countries but spruced up and maintained to Japanese standards. Needless to say, it is very clean, organized, and well-maintained. It is crowded compared to even the US parks but if you do your research and plan well, you'll have a great time."
"I tried to save time and drama by pre-purchasing tickets online only for my Australian CC -VISA to be rejected despite the bank assuring me everything was hunky dory with the card. I then purchased tickets through Viator.com only to have the tickets not recognised at the gate, all this mind you after lining up since 7am in order to purchase their fast pass tickets. Subsequently we lost our position in the queue and my young daughter was left in tears. I did not find the Tokyo Disneyland staff particularly helpful or sympathetic to our plight. The only staff member who came to help us addressed us with ""I don't speak English"". Luckily I speak Japanese and was also with a Japanese friend who explained the situation to her - fruitlessly as it turns out. We ended up having a disroganised, messed up day."
This is the 4th Disney I have visited and it didn’t disappoint. It was super busy but I still enjoyed every second of it. It’s a small world in Japanese is just brilliant.. Staff were all friendly and some spoke a little English. If you are in Tokyo I would recommend going.
Disneyland Tokyo held the magic we had come to expect. The rides were familiar so was the hospitality of the staff. We found the staff helpful and if possible prepared to help in anyway they could to make the day enjoyable. Although the park was very busy due to school holidays the number of rides and entertainments meant that although crowded  it didn't make it unbearable as our experience the day before and Tokyo Sea. A good day which left us feeling in good. Well done Tokyo Disneyland
I have been to Tokyo Disney a couple of times and it has never disappointed Staff are fantastic it’s clean , the fast tracks are free but you still need to time your rides as they do get very busy Food is well priced for an amusement park and not bad either Get in early and stay late , good day out
Abselutly everything is in japanese, all the rides,showes and staff only speak japanese. That really sucked and you had to wait for 40-110minutes for every ride
We went to Disney not our first timeBut the first time with our three year old. A lot of people said Disney is only for grown up children but I have to tend to disagree. We spent a whole day here and there was so much to see and a do with our three year old we went on a lot of rides and shows and also ate at the Japanese restaurant. Really would recommend Tokyo Disney especially on a weekday when we went as it was not that busy.
Tokyo Disneyland is as magical experience for every visitor. Based off the original Disneyland, this park features many of the much loved classic attraction and disney characters. The highlight of my day was the nighttime Parade, a must do for any visitor at the park. I highly recommend getting a snack and lining up 1 hour before the parade starts for a great viewing spot.
The family had a great day on the rides.  Best advice is to get the Fast track tickets.  You can get them every two hours. This enables you to get entry to the ride at a specific time frame and jump the normal queue. Only certain rides have them and certain one go quickly. Highly recommend the space rides and the gold mine roller coaster. Food was reasonably priced for a theme park but would suggest eating around 11am to avoid the crowds. We didn’t prepurchase the tickets and went on a Tuesday which is one of the more quieter days. One of us went to the ticket counter whilst the rest of the family waited in the entry line. Suggest you get there well ahead of opening time.
We visited Disneyland on a Wednesday and found that it was quite busy despite being a weekday. The park was easy to get to from Tokyo station by metro. We arrived around midday and there was a very small queue to buy tickets which was a nice surprise. Once inside, we rushed to the Monsters Inc ride - being one of the most popular rides here, we wanted to get a Fast Pass. Unfortunately the ride was closed unexpectedly due to technical issues, which was disappointing. We were advised to keep checking back during the day, which we did although it meant that this was time we could have used elsewhere in the park. It did open again but then closed a few times too - the queue was at least an hour long and they did not allow Fast Pass access. We eventually went on the ride at the end of the day after the fireworks, when the queue was much smaller.The park itself was clean and the staff were all very friendly. We enjoyed watching the parades from the Tomorrowland area - the Disney castle was therefore in the background and made for great photos. The fireworks  display at the end of the day was disappointing compared to other Disney parks as it did not last long.All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed the day and would certainly return. A few tips:- They have special stickers to wear for special occasions, available at Guest Relations (eg birthday).- The park map has a useful summary of all of the eateries and the kind of food they sell. Saves time so you know what to look for. Highly recommend the strawberry churros at Critter Country! - You can check in advance on the website what attractions etc will be closed for refurbishment and when.
Went on the 5th April and it was an absolute mad scramble. Although not during school holidays and during weekday, the number of people queuing up by 7:30am was enormous. We could not work out which queue was for tickets and which was for entry. When the gates opened, it was like the running of the bulls at Pamplona and many people running in with heaps of pushing and shoving. After seeing many young kids cry near the Buzz light year ride to shoot those aliens, I really did question why one would want to bring their child here.It is impossible to get on every ride in one day and using the fastpass system allows you get on more than you would. It very much is catered to locals with many having a yearly pass.I was also surprised that people start hogging spots for the parade from 10am in the morning and it creates a hazard and slows you down. Frankly Disney should stop people squatting for seats so early.My tip is run for the furthest rides away from the entry that are good and then move to get your first fastpass while you line up for your next ride and then just repeat getting fastpasses when you can for the big rides. However by 1pm, many attractions have already closed for fastpasses. For example Thunder mountain ride fastpass obtained at 11am was for a ride at 5pm. Tells you that Disney are admitting too many people in one day to be able to enjoy the experience. The night is a massive crush to, so you are better off watching the parade from the Western World. Restaurant food - you are also looking at at least 800Yen per person over and probably closer to 1,300Yen for a proper meal and that's not even in the top notch restaurant.
Experienced was ok. Very good for kids, not so much for adults. I thought we're going to see fireworks at night but turned out,it will be just a short show.
When in Tokyo what better place to tae the kids then disney! We loved it so much we came back the next day to disneysea.
Great fun for adults and kids alike. There are plenty of rides, attractions and the usual overpriced carnival food/souvenirs that you would expect to find. The wait for popular rides is usually over an hour if you don’t use the fast pass system. Scan your entry ticket once per hour at the fast pass booths next to the ride and in an hour or so you can join the fast line which moves much faster.I found it best to get your fast pass as soon as you get off each ride and enjoy some side shows in between to ensure you spend as little time in lines as possible.
We’ve been to Disney Florida/California/Paris in the past but have to say this is the cleanest Disney park we’ve been to! The staff are so friendly and welcoming. The rides are fantastic. There’s food to suit both western and eastern cuisines. A dream come true getting to visit this park.
We visited Tokyo Disneyland & DisneySea on two consecutive days in April. The parks themselves are beautifully done and spotless. We visited on workdays hoping for smaller crowds but both parks were completely overcrowded, which meant that even the rides for very small children had incredibly long lines. We ended up waiting behind hoards of teenagers (?) for small children’s rides that essentially lasted five seconds. No seriously, some of the rides were so short it was ridiculous! My daughter (5) also experienced some things that were unforgivable in my eyes, being pushed out of the way by hoards of teenagers to get up to a disney character. This of course isn’t the park’s fault but the ‘disney character’ in question did nothing to right the wrong and she was ignored for 5 minutes before we eventually gave up! We also got up to a long line of grownups (!) waiting to take a picture with mickey mouse, we proceeded to the back of the line, as my daughter was really excited about having her picture taken with Mickey but a rude lady did a cross with her arms and said “no!”. I asked her if she was really going to send away a little girl and she just gave a heartless “yes!”. So much for the magic of Disney! In other parks it’s all about the kids but this was really lost here! The woman’s response brings me to my next point, the lack of English. Many staff members speak next to no English and there are NO subtitles on ANY of the rides. We found this really lazy and as it’s an easy fix, we’re not sure why nothing has been done about this! We’re from Switzerland and regularly go to a park in Germany that manages to do everything in 3 languages, so it can be done! Essentially it wasn’t as magical as we were hoping for! :(
Purchase a 3 day pass.  Spent 2 days at Disneyland.  The place is really crowded.  Long queue to go in.  Do bring picnic mat for sitting while waiting for shows during the cold season.
We did a day trip with our 3 year old and it was great, she is small but was still big enough for plenty of the rides and we could go on with her, the wait times weren’t too long and the food options were great, the staff were so happy and so great with kids and were also very helpful. Loved it. the nighttime spectacular and the glow float parade was amazing.
Tokyo Disneyland is a place to have fun in the typical Disney fashion. This park is also vast so wear good shoes and prepare to walk a lot. Lines, for rides, can get pretty lengthy ,so take advantage of a Fast Pass when available.There are lots of restaurants and food carts scattered throughout the park for your convenience. When you book from abroad, Tokyo Disneyland does not make it easy to purchase tickets. There is no on line support/chat for international travellers -- only by phone. You are not guaranteed to get an English speaking cast member. Also Park hopper passes are not available.
Three adults and two small children tackled the crowds early in April.  It was the day before the school holidays started but it was definitely crowded.  However, we did expect this and planned ahead - which meant rushing to the popular rides first, then taking our time walking around, taking photos and eating.  It was a great day, beautiful weather but the two boys were exhausted.  We booked our tickets on line, not easy to do from Australia we discovered but there was absolutely no one in the queue to buy tickets on the day! So we could have got tickets on the day.  We also elected to get a car and driver to take us there and pick us up - expensive yes but very handy at 6pm with two exhausted boys who fell asleep on the drive home. We also got there at 7.45am - early and we expected to beat the crowds but I think everyone had the same idea.  Park opens at 8am and it was crowded!  The Dumbo ride was a minute long and was not worth the over an hour wait, but the Star Tours ride was excellent, Buzz Lightyears Astro Blasters was very good, Monsters Inc Ride and Go Seek was ok, Peter Pan's Flight was good and Tom Sawyer's Island was a nice respite.  Overall it was a fun day.  Disneyland is aimed at a younger audience (the boys were 8 & 4) and it was good for them.  Take a back pack, wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to queue.
loved our first visit here.  similar to Disneyland and Magic Kingdom but it has its own uniqueness. must see
went on 9th april. Wait times really good compared to Paris, used a couple of fast passes etc. We missed splash mountain as we went to Monsters inc and by then wait times were 80 mins so decided to skip it, splash mountain seems to have the longest wait to do it first!. Food prices were incredibly cheap. We had a large mickey shaped ice cream sandwich which cost £2.50, look at 10 euros in Paris. Lunch we had 4 mains, Japanese curry, and 2 iced coffees, came to £40. Lunch in euro cost us £50 for 2 mains and a snack. Rides did seem a little tamed down compared to Paris, but still good fun. Disney stuff also very reasonable, but we got our t-shirts at uniqlo.
The food prices were reasonable. Lines moved fast. Recommend the Disney app- wait times were accurate. Fun family experience. Worth the use of a day when visiting Tokyo. We did the 2 day pass and it was economical and worth our time and money
Very easy to access by train. Incredible amount of shops. 3 parades a day. Our favorite rides were Star Tours, jungle river and buzz lightyear. We spent 8 hours there and didn’t get to see everything. The attention to detail is second to none. The staff are full of big smiles and waves. The food was a bit disappointing - there was plenty to choose from but it was your typical junk food and was very expensive.
An awesome experience in Asia. It's pretty close the one in the US though most shows are in Japanese. The rides and food are closely the same with some special stuff like the alien mochi and special asian flavoured popcorns.It was a great trip for us and I enjoyed how clean it is! **though character greeting is a bit all-over the place...the rides and organization is superb!
one of the better disney parks that I've been too. make sure to get the different flavored popcorns with the character containers. i loved how clean everything was and how efficient the lines were. shows are in japanese but kids can still relate.
We went to ten Disney parks all over the globe this year and we absolutely enjoyed Tokyo Disneyland. The food was amazing and the Easter parade was spectacular. We lined up for 70 minutes at toon town to take a photo with Mickey wearing the fantasmic costume and it was worth it. Pls try the Katsu burger at toon town and the cinnamon churros.
i arrived at about 11am, so there was not a crowd at the gates.. proceeded to have my lunch first at the Japanese restaurant first since there is no crowd.. had my lunch and proceeded to all the attractions.. not a fan of rides so my wife and i were basically walking around and enjoying all the views and buying the souvenirs from the shops.. i went on a weekday and i feel the crowd is manageable so my advice is try not to go on a weekend cos i think the crowd will be overwhelming..
This was the final Disney park I had to visit on my quest to having been to all Disney resorts in the World.After a little disappointing day at the DisneySea (see my other review), this made us feel back home and happy again.Specially doing the classic rides Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain and Space Mountain gave us the Disney experience we wanted. And the night light parade was amazing! There are some things they should do something about to make it even better in my eyes:1) I know this is a Japanese park, but this is the only park in the world with next to no English on their rides. Thus making the dark rides almost useless, and a little more difficult for international visitors.2) They MUST do something about how many people they let in! There actually must be a way to have a full capacity and sell out because it was really over crowded. This was even on a regular weekday and we were told it is twice as many during the weekends, which must be unbearable. Tokyo is a huge city and most people can afford the steap Disney prices so something needs to be done!3) The official Disney stores products both inside and outside the park was not up to standard. On every single Disney we've been to in the world the suitcase have been filled with quality Disney merch such as limited edition artwork etc. This was not to be found at any stores in Tokyo, although we found some better quality products at the Disney Store in Shibuya.
Very busy, visited on a Tuesday, queues were around 30-45 min, very crowded. No big rides in this park. Space mountain is not like Paris / America if you have been to these parks with the bigger upside down roller coasters. Able to get fast passes around the park. The castle looks spectacular as always. More geared up for smaller children and families with regards to rides. But all in all a fun day out with fun food I haven’t had in other parks. If you want character photos, I learnt that you have to wave at the and they willCome over to you, not like Paris were you have to queue up.
You can not breath ! They sell their tickets more than it’s capacity!  Long cues for every single ride. Again no English !
All attractions, all workers all movies are in japaneese only.the park is amazing ofc.nothing to say, but super expensive to enter and to eat/drinkprepare your wallet with cash!
The Happiest Place on earth (aside from universal studious), my daughter loved the place as well for my wife when we have taken a picture with mickey mouse my wife is ecstatic. too bad it rained during the night parade but so far everything is nice, a memorable place to visit
We had the dubious misfortune of being there the week before the start of the Japanese school year (2nd week of April), and every student was at Disneyland. According to the Crowd Counter app, there were 65k people there every day that week. The most basic rides had very long waits and Fast Pass was done by little after noon. The park is nevertheless spotlessly clean and orderly, but the crowds were too much and the waits took away the fun. Wouldn't return.  Can say the same for DisnleySea.
This was our 4th Disney (including Hong Kong, Orlando and Shanghai) this one was very close to Orlando, compared to the others in Asia, this one is very big. The only down side were the staff. Found that a lot did not speak English compared to other Disney’s and a lot were very rude. Felt this was the least magical experience of all the Disney’s so far.
We visited as a family and had way more fun than I thought we would! The day we visited in January wasn't too busy so the wait times for rides were all under 45 minutes. It was very cold, so if you're visiting in January rug up. The rides were fab. The Peter Pan ride was a family favourite, as was the Buzz Lightyear ride. The older kid/adult loved Space Mountain. The It's a Small World ride was a strange one, go on it if you want the song stuck in your head for the next year and if you want to feel like Lisa Simpson when she was tripping. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was pretty good too. The parade is a must to watch, day and night. Plenty of characters wandering around, they do get mobbed but as the park wasn't crazy busy we managed to get some photos with them. Food was pretty good, there's a good selection available including for fussy kids. We especially loved the Mickey Mouse mini pizzas. It was a shame that some rides were closed in Toon Town while we were there, my husband was very sad he couldn't go on the Roger Rabbit ride lol. If you go in winter make sure you stop in the jail in Toon Town, there are heater vents which are delightful to stand under and defrost! Merch is expensive, as one would expect, but there is a big variety. Overall a fab place to spend a day/evening. We all loved it! We were there from open til close but still didn't manage to do everything. Would definitely need more than 1 day here on busy days.
I really enjoyed my visit here but forewarning do NOT buy a buy a ticket from trip advisor for here. I wasted 30 minutes at the ticket booth with the staff being confused by my ticket I got through trip advisor and told me they would not accept it because it was not an official disneyland ticket through them. The ticket I bought through trip advisor, hoping to save a little time and it was just the same price at Disneyland. However since they would not take my trip advisor ticket I had to pay for the ticket twice! The tickets on trip advisor are 100% not refundable so unless you want to waste $72 just pay for your ticket at the gate, it’s very simple and the staff are really friendly. I will not be using trip advisor again for any bookings.
We went to Disneyland to celebrate mum’s 65 birthday! The morning started with going from Shinjuku JR station to Tokyo on Chuou Line rapid ,Tokyo station was OMG , long walk to look for Keiyo Line and get off at Maihama. Once you are out of the station Disneyland is on your right hand side . Buying tickets was so easy , everyone was so friendly and happy. The amount of people in there was unbelievable and waiting time for the rides was about 1 hour on average so buying express tickets if you don’t want to wait! Everything you buy you have to line up for it some are shorter wait and some are longer wait ! We had a great time at Tokyo Disneyland!
Disney as well known by every generation.. this park give all memories. With fun rides. Accompanied with disney characters
Tokyo Disneyland is a gorgeous park especially during Sakura (cherry blossom season). The park can get exceptionally busy so plan ahead and use fast passes. Lots of unusual snacks to try particularly the popcorn flavours.
We have been to 3 different Disney's with our 5 year old daughter and this one is one of the best for kids her age. She could do all rides and loved some very much like Big thunder mountain and Space mountain, Its a small world, Go coaster roller coaster. The best part for us was the electric parade in the evening - with many amazing Tableau The fantasmic show on the castle was one of the best across any Disney's we have seen (and they are all great). The park is small and easy to cover in a day with kidsThe character greeting times are very long.
The day at Disney was very grey and cold but the experience was lovely. The food outlets were all reasonably priced. The ticket was around £50. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. The postal service, where I sent some postcards was an added bonus!
When it was my big Sisters birthday in Tokyo, I went to Tokyo Disneyland. I think it was a wonderful place to go for someones birthday. Here are my Top 2 reasons why I believe everyone should visit Tokyo Disneyland. Firstly it is so fun because the ride is so crazy ! There were so many people because Tokyo Disneyland is awesome.Finally, the staff are so nice. And the best ride is jet coaster.
14 hours on our feet but what a day and boy did we pack some inFrom the rides to the parades and fireworks displays these folks have it down to a fine artVisited on possibly one of the best clear days in April and the staff were brilliant and the park amazingly well kept and clean unlike Euro Disney that resembles a rubbish tipThis is the third Disney Park we’ve visited and by far the cleanest and friendliestWell done all, you are a credit to the park
Great Disney Park with wonderful Japanese flair.  Several unique rides like Pooh’s Honey Hunt and Monster’s Inc. that are unlike (and better than) similar rides in other Disney Parks.  Plus all the classics like Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, Haunted Mansion, Jungle Cruise (skip if you don’t speak Japanese), etc.  TDL has maybe my favorite version of Small World and very delicious and affordable snacks like popcorn (350JPY for a box, chocolate and caramel were our favorites) and Little Green Alien Mochi (350JPY for 3).  Get there early and stay late!  Crowds are impressive but the Japanese are very cordial and patient and don’t seem to mind waiting in crazy long lines for rides, food, characters, you name it.  But if you have a plan and make wise use of fast passes you can have a fun day without standing in any lines of longer than 25 minutes or so.
My friend and I just got back from a trip to Tokyo and we decided to goto disneyland while we were there. I would recommend going to more than a day if you want to do the rides. There’s 24/23 rides and we did 12 in two days. It’s easy to navigate once you get to know each area! 10/10 recommend!
A trip to Tokyo wont be complete without a trip to Disneyland specially when you have kids. We were planning to spend half day in disneyland and half day in disney sea but kids was having a blast and decided to stay in disneyland the whole day. It wasnt the first disneyland for them but its just tajt its disneyland how can you not stay for the parade. Of course first stop Its a small world our favorite ride. The wait was long but definitely a sight to see. My daughter loves seeing this ride. Since my kids are still young we just rode the jungle train, boat ride, mark twain boat, we watched the 3d show and we ate a lot of mickey mouse food. Then it was time for souvenir shopping while waiting for the parade to start. It was still a cold day in Tokyo but definitely a memorable day for my whole family.
Get in line early (we were in line an hour before opening). Possibly send someone to get fast passes while the rest of the group gets in line. (I would suggest splash mountain, Winnie the Pooh, space mountain, or thunder mountain railroad, depending on your group). Parks was beautiful, but crowded. Be prepared to wait and be patient.
AmazingHighlights are the shows and parades One mans dream 2 was well worth the visit and a great show that would be popular at any Disneyland resortThe parades are better than those in the states with the best electrical parade ever. You can view with ease and there was no need to camp out on the route for a good spot despite many people sitting hours before the parade starts. In Japan a lot of people sit on the floor during the parade so if you don’t mind standing away from the parade you can find a spot that over looks the crowd. Don’t expect to do everything, the parks are very busy. Get there earlier to get fast passes for the most popular rides as the fast passes close once all are distributed for the day and for the most popular rides this can be by mid day. Rides such as Winnie the poo, monsters inc., thunder mountain, space mountain. If the parks are open until 10, as they were in our visit, you can get on some of the other rides with ease. Our first day we were able to ride tiki rooms, bear jamboree, Pinocchio, Peter Pan, Snow White, small world, jungle cruise, haunted mansion and roger rabbit with ease.There are long queues for quick service and stalls, but if you are as happy with less popular options then you can get served quicklyThere is a band that plays on Main Street that is a must if you can catch them. Again better than any spontaneous show in Disneyland California, florida or Paris. Super friendly and helpful staff, great customer service. What ever japanese people tap in to for this should be bottled and sprinkled over the other parks around the world. I was touched by their smiles and kindnesses adding to magicEven though I could not understand what was said on the jungle cruise the cast member was really convincing funny and had amazing energy. The grotto that you go through mid ride has excellent effects not experienced in any other park listed above. We had a four day park ticket. We were surprised, having read reviews we thought we would like Disney seas better, separate review. Although we loved it, we were drawn back to Disneyland more often.  Our visit was Sunday Monday Tuesday and Wednesday. Surprisingly The Wednesday was the busiest. The start of their Easter event that is very popular in JapanGreat visit
I can just review this in one word!! Just awesome!!!!!!!. If you going their for the first time try to stay till the very end till 10pm ish !! And try to do all attractions there are plenty and it will take time. You can get a quick access by taking a special ticket. If you can try to avoid school holidays and weekends , cause it’s get very busy!!!! Like really busy !!! Have fun with your family and friends !!
This place is really wonderful for couples which is ironic because in the US it's more for family and friends. The ticket price particularly for afternoon admission is a real bargain. I went here with my boyfriend, and I had a great time. Everything is really cute, and the alien ice cream mochi are super cool. We went on a really cold day, but we still had a ton of fun watching the parade. And I would really recommend the Stitch show. It was hilarious particularly to adults. The park is very English friendly if you need to speak English. The only real drawback are the lines. The lines are pretty intense unless you go on a weekday which kind of sucks. Because the lines at the Florida one are so much shorter. A 3 hour wait time just isn't that unusual. But if you're willing to split up the single rider lines are awesome. The Buzz Lightyear ride was awesome as always. And Pooh's Honey Hunt, It's a small World, and the Haunted Mansion were all worth seeing. Everyone should go.
Disneyland was good , Only issue is there was between a 2 -3 hour wait for all the big rides and we were there on a Wednesday. They had the 35year parade which was excellent all shows and the grounds where what you expect from a Disneyland
Being a Sunday it was possibly the busiest place on earth, but certainly the happiest also. We didn’t purchase fast passes with kids aged 3 and 10 but for older kids or thrill seekers it would 100% be worthwhile fast passing. We aimed for attractions with a maximum 35 minute wait, with young kids we just couldn’t justify 3 hour wait times. We even waited 30 minutes for popcorn, it was so hard to get food or a seating area.Great facilities, we enjoyed the different sections and themes, the parade for 35th birthday was fantastic as was the evening parade with floats and characters lit up. Overall we had a great time, Disneyland is a must do. Take jackets so you don’t freeze at sundown!
From the moment you arrive you are greeted with a fantastic and beautiful setting which instantly makes you happy. Everything about this park is fantastic
Crazy crowded.  I will never complain about a 60 minute wait for Space Mountain in Disneyland Anaheim.  The wait at Tokyo Disney can go up to 3 hours!  There’s a line everywhere, but we still enjoyed it. The Pirates and Haunted Mansion are also the old version rides compare to Disneyland California.
We had a great time even with some wet days thrown in. We bought a four day pass for both Disneyland and Disneysea (park hopper)We spent two days in each park. We are Disney nuts and loved it!Highly recommend getting tickets in advance and getting there early. Head to back of the park as soon as you get in and work towards the front to avoid the long queues.The lines are really short after it gets dark. Loved trying all the different flavour popcorn. Winnie the Pooh ride isn’t like USA parks, can see the parades from the line up to Winnie the Pooh.Electrical Parade was great and enjoyed the Queen of Hearts Banquet hall (no reservations required)Definatley worth a day in each park but if you only have one day do Disney Sea as it’s unique.
Found the cast members to be friendly and helpful even with the large crowds.  We saw reviews that suggested two days at this park, but if you've been to a Disneyland theme park before, base your time on that experience.  We felt like we did everything we wanted to do in one day.  Three down, three to go.
I visited all Disneyland parks around the world and I can say this is the worst one, long line for ticket no VIP tickets, long line for food, no good attactions and no Disneyland castle which surprised us, we will never return back to this place.
I have visited several Disney parks over the years.  Whilst no expert, I understand better than many as to what you should and shouldn't do to get the most out of your visit. No matter what you hear or research...NOTHING can prepare you for the crowds and lining up required at both Disneyland and Disneysea. We chose a Tuesday for Disneyland and a Wednesday for Disneysea.  There was nothing special about this week - it was not a holiday or busy week in Tokyo.  It was classed as a moderately busy period on the Disney calendar. Even at almost an hour before park opening time there were easily already one thousand ticket holders lining up ahead of us.  This truly surprised me as in my experience a similar Tuesday at Anaheim doesn’t draw this kind of line an hour before opening.It does not stop there….. Once inside, you line up for a lengthy period for almost everything from attractions, parades, and food  - even 45 minutes for a cup of coffee. I will note we did not need to line up to use the bathroom at any time which was great (and a welcomed surprise to be honest).  I even saw several groups of people setting themselves up to watch the parade - over three hours before the parade starting time.We are two healthy men and could race around the park easily so we still managed to make the most out of our day and have a terrific time.  I seriously don’t know how all of you with children manage it - you truly are miracle workers.The park is very clean and runs very smoothly. It has a great Disney atmosphere and all cast members we encountered were happy and helpful. I do think they need to think about adding some coffee carts rather than coffee only being available at the cafes to hopefully reduce the long wait for such a simple purchase.Here are some tips (some are bleedingly obvious but to a novice maybe not):Note: How you spend your first hour is crucial and sets up the rest of your day for success or potential disappointmentBuy your tickets in advance - either online or via a registered seller in TokyoGet there at LEAST one hour in advance before park openingWhilst in line request a park and parade times brochure and start planningDownload TDR Alert which is an app that will show current wait times and whether they have a fastpass available.Decide on your four MUST DO rides and work out a schedule. If any of them have a Fastpass available race to this attraction upon entry to get a return pass for it and then over to the next closest attraction on your list.  Hopefully it will still only be a 5 - 15 minute wait and you can ride this and possibly still go onto the next ride on your list all within the first hour.Pay close attention to the time on your fastpass ticket that tells you when you can get a second fastpass for another ride.  If this time is BEFORE the return time of your first fastpass get your second fastpass BEFORE returning to your first fastpass ride. Try not to get distracted in this first hour.  Pay no attention to any shops or characters that are there to divert your attention.  It is vital you get your big four done first up.  Then you can relax somewhat for the rest of the day.Pack some snacks that will help you all until meal breaks.  Consider having meal breaks a little bit earlier or later than normal.  For lunch consider 11am over 12 noon, or 4.30pm instead of 6.30pm.Rides such as ‘It’s A Small World’, ‘Castle Carousel’ and ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ appear to have fairly small wait times so I advise you to add these to your list later in the day. It helps give more bang for your buck.
It looks so cool and now i want to go i have to do this is an asiment in school for japanese i loved this place it was so intresting.
Queueing for the Magic lives on show. Wife bringing child to toilet. Due to limited seat, staff disallowed me to reserve for them. That's fine. When wife arrives with child after toilet break (super long Q as i doubt TDR controlled the no. of visitors even they declared so), my wife was told the capacity is full and disallowed to enter. That's fine. I asked the staff to let my child sit on my lap without disturbing anyone with wife waiting outside. Again was rejected. Seeing the disappointment of my child, i asked the staff and manager tolet my child enter by herself. Again, rejected as my 6yo child is not meeting age requirement. Then, i suggested my child stand from the back to see the show, within leaving our sight. Again,TDR staff said so sorry... End up my whole family left with extreme disappointment with none wacthing the show even we have 1 seat. This was our 2nd day here but didnt even managed to see the show after 4th try. A terrible place with inconsiderate TDR staff. I highly recommend Hong Kong Disneyland over Tokyo. Will never visit TDR again. For those who think of coming, think twice unless you prepare to queue more than 1 hour for each rides or show.
TD Parks are really amazing, Tokyo Disney land and Tokyo Disney Sea are state of art resorts, always very busy. Great values if visit in evenings. Star light Passport is great for price. There are lot of discount packages if bought out side with hotel or train tickets. There are Restaurent’s and food is very expensive and always too many people. Please keep water and some quick foods if visiting with kids. Very clean park, may be number one in world Disney resorts.
We came from Australia for a family day trip to Tokyo Disneyland, it was something our children (3 over 18) we decided to do the top 8 rides before getting there however the queues were up to 3 hrs. On the plus side there were clocks at each ride to tell you waiting times.  We managed to do 4 rides before deciding enough was enough for us, I have no idea how little children would fare.  It is Japan thou so no one was grumpy.We would not bother with this trip againhowever we noted during the time we were waiting that there. Is a fast pass available which we don’t know the cost of but those going through using those passes jumped the queues by at least a couple of hours. There should be info available to googleAlso crowds were huge so it would be well worth finding out when their school holds are as numbers may be bigger
Had a whole lot of fun here with my family. The rides were all family friendly which allowed everyone to enjoy it at the same time. Try all the different kind of churros there, they could really surprise your tastebuds. Get your fastpass as quickly as you can so you could enjoy and stroll through the park for the whole day.
After 4 years visited Disneyland again but this round with young kid at 11months old. Baby friendly toilet and a lot of rides also suitable for young kids.
If you have whole day free time, the place will be good for you.  As you know, you need to research the place ahead of time from their website.  I would love to share efficient way to visit there.  First of all, please buy ticket from the online.  Discount ticket only can purchase from the Website, please do not order ticket from website after you arrive in Japan.  The company does not accept foreigners credit card on their website.  So you need order your ticket before you depart your country.  Depend on the situation, you can not purchase their ticket at the box office in TDL.  Second, as much as you can, please get Fast pass.  You do not need wait more than 20 minutes.  Third, food sections also have long line, waiting time average 30 minutes to order.  Please eat big breakfast and then visit there will be good for you.  They are not allowed to bring your personal foods.  All those reasons, I will purchase fast pass package ticket next time.  I hope you can enjoy with your friends and family.  30 minutes by car from Tokyo station.
150 minute waits for rides, bad hot dogs and about 10,000 people more than the place could handle. The fast pass system is a joke, we only managed to reserve one before the system closed for the day (they make you wait several hours before you can reserve another and the good rides book out quickly).The roller coasters are very tame but that makes them good for young kids. On the good side, the locals seem to love it and the place is spotlessly clean and feels very safe. My tip is to bring good shoes because you will be doing lots of standing.
My kids love everything in Disneyland and it’s a very happy place! Weather was good to us. Services also excellent.
We went on the first Tuesday of March and it was busy. We went as a family of four with a 10month old in the pram and our 3 year old walking or sitting on dads shoulders when she needed a break. We did a bit of research in regards to fast passes and which rides we most wanted to go on before we went to Disneyland. We arrived 10mins before park opening and the lines were huge but don’t worry they move really quick, we were inside in about 5mins. My husband immediately went and collected a fastpass for the Winnie the Pooh ride and then we basically walked onto it’s a small world after all ride. This was a great ride, kids loved it. We all rode the Peter Pan ride (25min wait), baby included as well as the teacup ride (5min wait) and carousel ride (5min wait), skipped the dumbo ride which was a 35min wait which seemed excessive for the type of ride it was, although we did it the second day when it was raining a bit and wait time was only 5mins. Pooh was awesome and both kids loved it. Castle was fun to see inside, remember to use your flash when taking photos and some magic might happen. We did two days at Disneyland, which we needed and we still didn’t do everything. Adults favourite ride was Star Wars tour. Three year olds favourite ride was buzz lightyear Astro blasters which we did three times over two days. Monsters inc ride was also pretty good. The space mountain ride was very disappointing, don’t expect it to be very thrilling if you’re use to proper roller coasters. It was basically a very basic indoor roller coaster with flashy lights. I wouldn’t recommend wasting time going on this ride or wasting a fastpass on it like I did. Save your fast passes for monsters inc, buzz lightyear ride and Pooh ride especially if you’ve got kids. There’s a play area in toon town for kids to run around in. Favourite food was mickeys glove sandwich with Chinese chicken on and the lightsaber churro. Make sure to use fast passes and download english TDR ride times on your phone it was very good for checking ride times and fastpass return times. We stayed in the resort area so we could get to parks early without having to travel and to also go back to hotel throughout day for kids to have a rest. We stayed at Sheraton which was great. Do not miss the nighttime parade and light show on the castle. The daytime parade was skippable if you don’t have time. The night parade was the best parade I’ve ever seen in my life. For the best seats get there at least 45mins before parade starts and pick out your spot. There will be massive lines for the more popular rides so use fast passes wisely. We went on average crowd day for both days we went apparently and for us it was still pretty busy. We really enjoyed our experience at Disneyland overall.
Been waiting years to visit Disneyland and I’ve done the Tokyo Disneyland. It was busy and crowds were everywhere, but the Japanese know how to move crowds, the main attractions had the biggest crowds but within an hour you were on a ride, make sure you get fastpass on your favourite ride as you’ll go straight into the ride, you can only get one at a time and have to use it first before you get another one. I loved the Star Tour and Space Mountain Rides, but the haunted mansion was good too.This place is magical and if your in Tokyo I would highly recommend it.
This park is NOT owed by the Walt Disney Company. It operates under a licensing agreement and it shows. This park is superior to all other Disney parks. Park is clean beyond any standard. The attention to details is everywhere. Expect BIG crowds everyday of the week.
We spent the best part of a day (10am-8pm on a Monday) at Disneyland Tokyo. The queues weren’t as bad as expected (5-10min queue to get in) although the morning was a little rainy so may have put people off. The popular rides were longer waits (space mountain, roller coasters, log ride etc). In any case the rides notify you at line up the expected wait time so you can decide before joining the queue if you are up for the wait. The staff were everywhere and very helpful, happy & smiley. We watched the night time parade which was hands down the best parade we’ve ever seen, worth securing a spot on the route for. Overall we all had a fab day, it felt like we were in a magical land removed from the real world. Oh and highly recommend the Jungle Cruise in Adventureland, unexpectedly awesome.
Disney's not a high thrills type of theme park, with the rides definitely being on the tame side, but it does fun extremely well. It managed to make a pair of forty somethings feel like kids again with stylish rides and great shows. The queue times are an issue, making repeating popular rides like Space Mountain and Thunder Mountain impractical, but there's plenty to do still. The electric lights parade and the fireworks are a must see and we were lucky enough to catch the 35th anniversary show, which was amazing. The food available is okay and reasonably priced without being amazing and the park is incredibly clean. Would happily visit again. The only issue we had was our card not being accepted online so we had to buy a ticket on the day - Tokyo Disney, please sort out your payment portal as this was a real hassle.
"Hi and thx for reading again. Was here recently as 2A&2C(16&17 years old)Positive- much bigger than Hongkong - Mickey Disney character shaped ice cream- Much better crowd controlled for the nightly fire works display, march pass & shows- get to visit and go up the Disney tower - water dispensers sparsely located near outdoor activity lines - FREE fast pass located at entrance of some activity - many retail stores for die hard souvenir fans with views of actual glass shaped makers - allowed us to bring in water bottle & middle sized knapsack full of food & chips though we were searched at the entrance. Don’t know if we were lucky as their website says one “MAY” not. 😅- activity brochures are in many languages & even Bahasa M’sia- many come mildly dressed & yes even adults in their favorite characters Negative- directions & explanations are in Japanese mostly though a couple have English; no fault of theirs as the park crowd are mainly the locals. - can’t finish everything in a day if one doesn’t arrive earlyConclusion Will return as there’s a new section opening next year."
We spent the day at Disneyland and had a nice day with the kids.  This place is nice for younger kids maybe 3 to 12 years old. Not too many exciting rides for teenager.Clean environment and interesting shops, restaurants and rides. Queue can be long for some rides.We especially liked the parades. There is a parade during the day and a night time parade which is really colourful. Try and catch both the parades as well as the fireworks at the end of the night.  One thing which we found strange was that the fireworks should have come immediately after the night parade. But instead, we had to wait another half hour to see the short fireworks display.It was a little too cold for some of us as it was winter. Probably better to come during better weather like spring or autumn.
I would like to purchase my ticket via online and printed at home. Because i am travel with children and it seems cheaper.Do i need to change my ticket when i enter into park? I am travel total 8 person with children
Tokyo Disneyland is one of the most impressive disneyland parks Ihave ever visited.It is the only Disney Ocean Park in the world.It has reached the highest level of comfort of park area,entertainment items and number of people.Tokyo Disneyland is currentlythe most popular Disneyland.There are very few people,so the waiting time for each   other is very short.By contrast,Hong Kong's area is too small.There are too many people in Shanghai's and there are too few people in Paris's.Tokyo Disney is quiet and beautiful,staying there for a nenight is also recommended.You can go to Disney Ooean Park the next day.The whole Tokyo Disneyland resort is very mature.The environment is also very good.There are many hotels and you can go there by trains or buses.So the transportation is very convient.
Even on rainy days with thousands of school kids out on break this place does not disappoint. Went for one day - the parades were great, waited for rides but only 10 to 15 minutes. There should have been more characters walking about and Mickey's House had a 1.5 hour wait but the day was great for the whole family. We didn't eat in the park though.
Day 2 in Japan,we went to Disneyland in Tokyo.It's very interesting,I played a variety of roller coasters.The roller coasters here seem to have entered into fairy tale woulds.I am amazed by them.
All Disney theme parks makes everyone feel like kids again. Just being in the park makes one very happy already, though the queues may be super long! Enjoyed all the rides and shows, enjoyed just walking around.. the F&B outlets, and of course, the nice parades and light shows...
Disneyland is a must if you have never been there1. lots of restaurants with a variety of food (Can be pricey)2. The rides are very kid friendly. 3. The Parade.however bear in mind that the popular rides does have a massive queue time. e.g the roller coaster & haunted house is approx 1hr minimum wait.Overall definitely go if you have never been. It is breathtaking the first time around
Wonderful staff compliment all the amazing attractions.  Although very little English, this didn't diminish from a wonderful (& long) day.
I should more learn abt fast pass before I go. if you know abt fast pass very well, you will enjoy more if you don't, this fast pass will drag you to hell. I think maybe it is better that Disney get rid of fast pass. due to this pass, 1 hour waiting can be 2 hour or may 3 hours which will see take u into the hell. please educate yourself with this info before you go yet my niece really enjoyed Disneyland so I am happy. it was my main reason to have a trip to Japan for this time.  Japan Disneyland was all right buy if you are really up for Disney, of course I do recommend US. :)
We went on a weekday and it was still quite busy, there were lines for everything, including the street food vendors. There are no fast passes you can buy, only tickets that allow you to come back at a certain window (which can be 3 or 4 hours after you get the ticket). We waited 100 mins for Space Mountain which is considered a fair waiting time. If you are interested in Disney but not set on the traditional Disneyland, I recommend DisneySea which is just next door. We were able to do a lot more rides there, and it’s a really cool park with lots to see!
Tokyo Disneyland  fairy tales, some rides , Disney characters, day long fun for family , elders do live there chilhood memories, shops and evening parade was excellent after sunset the laser and fireworks, must visit when in Tokyo ... take a train from Tokyo station to Mahimama station on JR line  very convenient
We visited Disneyland in early January (during the holiday week) and started out with a group,of 13 - 7 of us big kids at heart and 6 little excited kids aged 4 to 8 years. The visit included a very early morning train up to Tokyo, change train to subway about 1.5 hrs total ( and return at days end). It was a fantastic day, we all had the best time. Kids beside themselves with excitement and the thrill. I purchased the tickets within Japan ( I am a non Japanese speaking nonna) and I used a machine at our local Chigasaki 7 eleven,  with a little in store help. Absolutely no problem. We availed ourselves of the Fast Pass System for rides etc when possible, it saves queuing....Plenty of food and drink and bathroom options everywhere. One day is probably not enough time, but we did our best to see and do, keeping in mind our little fellow travelers. Our train journey home we used the Green Car option on JR as sure to get a seat for the kids, and can eat and drink...we bought snacks at Tokyo Station for trip home. Such a fantastic fun day the grandees (and our own kids) will remember- doing Disney with all your cousins. Priceless.
"Busy throughout the year like most Disney Parks. As a tall guy I did find it a struggle to get into some of the rides but I was able to fit them all (I'm 6' 4""). The trick I found was to cross my legs and move feet as far back as I could before sitting down. Indian Jones was no problem but them kept pulling me out of the line to measure my height. This turned out to be a good thing, as each time they did it and were happy I got to jump 1/3 of the line and my wife and daughter got to come too. On Hyperspace mountain avoid the front row of each card, again the staff will likely call this out to you when you join the line.We knew very little Japanese, they knew very little English, but everything just worked."
Enjoy with family spend time in Tokyo Disneyland u will forget what time and kids don’t want back home
Happiest place for kids. Well maintained parked. Trash bins everywhere. You will need at least 1-2 days to complete all the rides.Drawbacks:1. Fastpass finishes quickly. Do your research and pickup the fastpass immediately upon entry. I recommend picking up Winnie the Pooh's fastpass. It's the most popular ride in the park.2. Only 2 designated smoking areas. Adding 2 more will be more convenient for me.
planning is essential especially this is one of the busiest DL in the world. We all had a great time. maximize the use of fast pass. The food choices are limited compared to HK DL. But the total experience is very good.
We bought the vacation package which includes a certain amount of fast passes. Therefore, we need not join the public to queue for certain time slot’s fast passes for those popular rides. My girl’s current height is more suitable for Disneyland, in comparison to DisneySea.She is very happy that she is guaranteed entry (as she is a guest at the Disney hotels) even on crowded days, also the fact that the fast passes we had can be used at any time slot (during the operation timing of the park) and skipped the long waiting time (we still need to wait but much much faster than those who do not have fast passes...for example, the normal waiting time for those without fast passes will be 90mins while we only waited about 15mins).We bought lots of popcorn holders (different themes) and tasted at least 3 different flavours out of the available flavours.I purposely arranged this trip to tap on the 35th anniversary before it ends on mid March this year but the popcorn holder (Mickey Mouse with the 35th anniversary symbol) was sold out. But well, i managed to get the other ornament item which strongly signifies this anniversary, so I am still contented.I personally strongly encourage families with young children to consider purchasing the vacation package (no such package for Hong Kong Disneyland which we went in October 2016), as it brings lots of convenience despite that my husband and I do not understand Japanese and speak extremely limited Japanese.
Everything was great, it's so big that throughout the day we hardly covered 50% of iy. customer service was good, even though they don't speak English well, they were always there to help out. Very positive atmosphere. The Haunted House is the best!
We arrived shortly after 9am by train and after making our way to the park, we’re immediately met by queues. Each ride was a minimum 50-80 min wait, meaning with lunch and shopping, we were able to do 6 rides before leaving at 7:30pm.If you’re wanting to see it all, you’ll definitely want to buy a multi-day pass. Overall wasn’t a terrible day, but I wish we had more time to see everything...there’s always next time!
I will start off by saying we did enjoy our time, however the fact that the fast passes can be booked within the first 30 min of the park opening and items being sold out within a couple hours is something we did not enjoy. This is an example of the mindset of people at the park when we went. But the part that saddened us the most what when I asked a cast member what the new wait time was for the line since the posted time was not at the end of the actual line, she looked at me as if we were bothering her and then walked away.
I'm a huge Disney fan and I've been to the original Disneyland in California at least a dozen times over the years (plus Disney World once). I wasn't sure what to expect with my first visit to a international Disney park, but Tokyo Disney exceeded all of my expectations. To summarize: Tokyo Disney is incredibly detailed, has great unique rides only found in Japan, has much better food than the American parks, and the staff was friendly and amazing. Tokyo Disney does a great job of capturing the magic found in the original Disneyland.Hints for first time visitors:Tokyo Disney has great (only found in Japan) rides like Pooh's Honey Hunt and Monsters Inc, plus a new Beauty and the Beast Ride opening in 2020 that looks amazing! They also have most of the famous Disney rides found in other parks: Pirates of the Caribbean, Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, the Haunted House, Its a Small World, Peter Pan, Roger Rabbit, Star Tours, Jungle Cruise, Buzz Lightyear, Etc.Make sure to utilize fastpass tickets to avoid long lines. The park is very popular, and can get crazy busy, so avoid holidays, weekends, and try to go on a weekday.Pirates of the Caribbean isn't very popular in Japan, and normally has a 5-10 minute wait. Still a great ride. Buy your tickets online beforehand to skip the line.Try the food: It is so much better than the food in the American Parks. They have crazy flavors of popcorn (like Curry), teriyaki chicken legs, seafood pizza, good ramen, and countless crazy desserts.Disney Sea is a separate park located across the street, you need a separate admission ticket to enter it. It has the awesome Indiana Jones ride, Tower of Terror, Toy Story Mania and other fun rides. Their is no hopper pass to run back and forth between the parks like in California.My only criticisms: Their Tomorrowland had a very dated feel to it, it did contain all the great rides (Space Mountain, Star Wars, Buzz Lightyear). But it just felt weak in details compared to the rest of the park.Also, their Adventure Land only contained 2 rides, and didn't contain The Indiana Jones ride (they do have Indiana Jones at Disney Sea across the street), which left only the train and the Jungle Cruise. Adventure Land could really use a big E-ticket attraction.Highly recommend a visit for any Disney fans.
You will have the best day ever. Just put in your mind that everything inside is in Japanese language but you will enjoy every moment.
A lot of fun. Interesting for all ages. We spent all day there from morning until closing and couldn't see everything. A lit thing to see. But one minus: too many people
"Our 2nd DL after Paris. Our kids are 10 & 8 and I think next time we will visit Disney Sea as the rides in DL I think are more geared up towards younger kids. We spent 100mins queuing for both Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain which really eats into your day, but these were the two most ""exciting"" rides available that day in the Park. We managed to get a Fast Pass for Pooh's Hunny Hunt so we saved 60mins there.Top tip is that I would recommend that you buy your tickets BEFORE you arrive at the Park, otherwise you'll be double queuing (once for tickets and then once to get in).We stayed in Odaiba which wasn't too far away and had good attractions / shopping / food for the kids.  What I didn't know and the really helped was finding out that LAWSONS or FAMILY MART (convenience stores - you'll find them everywhere) sell Disneyland tickets (there's a machine near the door, I just asked the staff member to help me buy tickets).  This was awesome as it made buying the tickets super easy and convenient.Also we could take food and drinks into the Park. I'd heard you couldn't but this wasn't true."
Our third Disneyland after Paris and Hong Kong. Definitely better than Hong Kong and Paris. Rides were newer and the crowd better. We didn't wait too long for most of the rides even without fast pass. Watched the parade and fireworks. So cool! Towards closing time, we even managed to go on one more ride. Only negative feedback: food and drinks were expensive. Don't remember if Paris and Hong Kong were as expensive as here.
We had a great time specially with Star Wars ride. We love it, it was a great way to spend a couple of days.
We visited the park for one day whilst visiting Tokyo. I personally found the park, the attractions and the food so much better than Disney Hong Kong and Disney Shanghai. For me, Disney Tokyo is on par with Disney in Paris. Picking up our tickets was a strange experience, we collected them in the airport on our arrival before going to disneyland the next day! If visiting please be mindful of this as European guests who have been to Paris might think you collect your pre-paid tickets from Disneyland on the day you visit. Very enjoyable experience, although it was very cold and wet at times in February. Please wrap up warm is visiting in winter, also strong, waterproof, comfy footwear is a must! A lot of walking will be done if you want to see everything. Also prepare for a very long day, we left our Tokyo hotel at 5am and got hone at midnight! The subway us quite easy to work out so no taxi required. The park was very busy which reflected its popularity. All the staff were very kind and helpful. I think this was the cleanest themepark I have ever visited! The shops are great, be sure to leave enough time to check them out. There is a disney village type place nearby however there is nothing disney there, apart from the largest Disney store in Tokyo I believe (which I found to be quite average-sized and chaotic), I would actually avoid! I would definitely visit again if staying in Tokyo.
In all honesty, I prefer Disneyland than DisneySea. Due to big part of the crowds. DL crowds are not too bad, and most rides only had 20-30minutes wait vs DS 90-120 mins wait. Also, their parades and fireworks are amazing. With DS, the fireworks are hidden behind a few building!
Very similar to Disneyland in Anaheim except it's a lot more spacious and much cleaner, with more shops. You'll really like the extra square footage because there will be tons of people when you arrive.Took my family to see this. Although, things are a bit expensive the experience was fantastic. What an experience.
I have had the pleasure of visiting 4 of the 6 Disney Theme Parks worldwide and I have to say that Tokyo Disneyland is absolutely one of the best. It captures the magic of the original Disneyland in Anaheim, while boasting the size and grandeur of Disney World in Orlando! The Cast Members here are also extraordinarily friendly and a joy to be around. The shows are absolutely incredible and the atmosphere gatherings are nothing to turn your nose up at! You absolutely have to try as much food from the stands around the park as you can (especially all the different flavors of popcorn and maybe a seasonal churro)! Also much more moderately priced than the parks in America. Definitely a must see if you enjoy Disney and are visiting Tokyo!
We visited Tokyo Disneyland one day after we visited Tokyo DisneySea and our daughters loved Disneyland a bit more as there were more rides that they liked 💕 The lines were fairly long for the rides but they were worth it as the rides had heaps of detail and were “super fun” Some of the rides to remember to ride are the haunted house  🏚
"After a long time of closure due to rennovation, ""It's A Small World"" is back! It has new additions of figures from famous cartoons."
It has been couple of years since we visited Tokyo Disneyland. The experience is good as same same last time and even better since this year is 35th anniversary. They got lots of special event going on. Although there are lots of people and we eventually need to wait almost over at least 45 mins for game but still worth it. As you can experience the Japanese style of line up. It is a very different experience compare to HK Disneyland. There are some expansion going on and i guess get prepare for the 2020 Olympics. Surely will go back sometime soon.
We had a great time here! Bought a three day pass that allowed entry to both Disneyland and Disneysea. After doing one day at each park we decided to come back to Disneyland.We were concerned that it would be too crowded having read the reviews. It was busy, but by using the fast passes we managed to ride everything we wanted without waiting in too many long lines. We visited on a Monday and Wednesday.There are rides for younger children and thrill seekers. Although Disney sea has more thrill seeker rides.Great Disney atmosphere, beautiful well kept park. Food is ok, reasonably priced compared to what you’d pay at parks in Australia.Loved it!
Skip the queue by getting your tickets online. Do plan out your route before heading there as the place is huge and requires quite a bit of walking. Disneyland has rides for young and for thrill seekers. Fast pass collection could run out by mid day. Do try food at different restaurants as the restaurants serve different ‘signature’ food.
Been to a number of Disney parks and this has to be my 2nd fave after the original Disneyland in Anaheim. Very chill park, can be very busy but everyone just patiently waits and is polite. Love the way everyone gets completely on board with matching hats and outfits- v cute. You'll need more that one day here. Stay for the night time electrical parade.
We went on a wwek day to avoid too big a crowd. I don't think that worked. It was very crowded.  We waitied on average 30 to 40 minutes for rides. However once in it was worth the wait. There's lots to see and do and it's a kids paradise that adults will certainly enjoy. It's a Small World ride is a must.
"Great time, for a Disneyland experience in Tokyo.I wasn't sure what to expect, with only gone to the one in Florida.The price for one day was roughly $80 American.  Which is less than what you would pay in Florida or California.  At least half the price, compared to the one in Florida.The park is setup beautifully but the park does get extremely busy.  But really no different than what I experienced when I was in Florida.  The announcements also go out in English as well, if anyone might be wondering.  You will also see people cosplaying as their favorite characters from Disney walking around.  And if you ask them, they will gladly take a photo with you.Disney does a bang up job on making everyone have a great experience.  Even in Japan.And I do mean everyone.  Even the staff that clean the park are very friendly, courteous, and very helpful.As I was lining up for the Space Mountain ride, one of the staff members who's English was pretty good, warned me about the seat height, and that I may have to scooch down a bit.  Which was very nice and helpful.  Since I stand at 6'-2"" (188cm).They had parades going through the park a few times a day and a couple at night.The night parade was beautiful.I'm glad I went there for the experience.  Disney, plus the staff didn't disappoint.If you like Disney and you were curious about checking it out, when you're in Tokyo, then I think it is well worth it."
Similar enough to the California park to feel nostalgic about it. But different enough that it is worth a visit. I had such a good time. Also the things they sell are so different from the things at US Disneys
Disneyland is a place where many miracles and magic moments happened. Tokyo Disneyland is quite easy to access as the metro has clear instructions and information signs. I went to the Disney on 1/1, which really too crowded to go, we had to queue for at least  2 hours for every game, thought they were worth to wait. The 35 anniversary celebrations and the new year celebrations were fantastic, really enjoyed the paradise and the music show. 🥳I definitely will visit again, but will choose a day which is not a public holiday 😂
Always a great place to visit with young children. The fastpass is always worth getting, particularly for very popular rides like Toy Story at Disneyland Sea. If only visiting one park, we’d recommend choosing Disneyland Sea. The food and souvenirs are reasonably priced and of good quality. The various flavoured popcorns are worth trying and the themed popcorn buckets are a hit with the kids. The locals love to dress up at Disneyland which is a wonderful spectacle that adds to the atmosphere of Tokyo Disneyland. Higly recommended particularly for families for young children.
Basically a smaller version of Disneyland in Anaheim. Went mid-December and the park was not crowded at all. Able to ride everything we wanted with reasonable wait times for those rides we did not have a FastPass for.If you enjoy Disneyland, you will enjoy Tokyo Disneyland.
Disneyland never failed. It was great to be there. Every disney park has its own theme. when i visit there on january, its quite empty, the queue was not take so long. The parade and the lighting show so great. My kids really love their visit here.
If you are a big Disney fan and really invested in all the characters and films then Disneyland Tokyo is for you! Full of amazing attractions and rides, and fun for the whole family. Be prepared for an expensive day out with all the food stalls and carts being quite costly. I highly recommend the churros and pork legs as well as a visit to the Queen of Hearts Cafe.
"We bought an ""after 6 passport"" and spent a lovely night racing around to all the major rides in Disneyland. We went back the following day with a day pass to enjoy the remainder of the park. Having been to Tokyo Disneyland approximately 20 years ago, I knew it wasn't as big as Anaheim (which we visited 6 years ago), but it was still a great experience. I do feel it lacked a little of that Disney ""magic"". Maybe it was because the characters were not roaming. Having said that, we did visit during the July heatwave, so that is understandable. It was a great day with the family, but our family (2 adults and 2 teens) enjoyed Disney Sea more."
I'm not sure if I'd have liked it more if it was my first experience, but having been to the one in Paris several times, this comes nowhere near the Paris experience, I expected more and this one definitely isn't worth the price and waiting time to get in, very over prices and poor value for money.
Compare to Hong Kong, this park is much better, less crowded, people are more organised, and friendly. My both of my sons,  8 years old and 2 years old enjoyed it very much.Perhaps it is best to take one kid each and split up because most rides has height restriction.
Excellent place to enjoy with children. We went on the last 2 days of the Japanese school winter break, and were lucky not to have to queue too long (fewer people).We managed to get Fastpasses for popular rides, which further reduced queuing time. An added plus is that Japan being Japan, every corner of the park was extremely well maintained.
We've visited Disneysea the past 2 years but haven't been to Tokyo Disneyland in about 18 years, so it would be our younger son's first time there. All the advice I've read said to be there early so we arrived about 7:15 for the 8:00am opening. There must have been at least 40 people in front of us in one of the shorter lines to the entrance! People do get up super early to stand in line at Disneyland!Our first stop when the park opened (no announcement or rope drop here!) was the fast pass for Monsters Inc ride, which I think is only at this Disneyland. By the time we got there, it was already the 11:15 fast pass. Then we went to Space Mountain and the line there was 1/2 hr. One thing to note about Space Mountain at this Disneyland, there is NO music on the ride! It was so disappointing since that is one of my favorite parts of this ride. After Space Mountain, we went to Pirates ride (same as the US version) which had a 10 minute wait, the Star Tours ride (different endings like the US Disneyland) - 10 minute wait, and Haunted Mansion (It was the Night before Christmas version) - 1/2 hr wait. We also got a Big Thunder fast pass for 1:00pm.Monster's Inc ride was okay. The ride is built like the Buzz Lightyear ride and instead of shooting targets, you shine flashlights at targets. But there is no score so after a little bit, it got sort of boring. Maybe it's fun for little kids, but the lines here are the longest in the park so I don't think it's worth lining up for more than once. It's better if you have a fast pass but those run out quite early.Lunch was at Plasma Ray's since it was one of the few places that offered vegetarian food. The vegetable curry we got was decent and the prices were ok for Disney. We also picked up a Darth Vader popcorn bucket and got a coupon for popcorn at another popcorn stand (corn potage popcorn did not sound appetizing but was popular).Before Big Thunder fast pass was good, we also got a fast pass for It's a Small World ride. That was a big surprise since that ride usually doesn't have much of a line anywhere else in the world. The standby line was over 1/2 hr so we used the fast pass thinking maybe it's different from other It's a Small World rides. No, it's the same, just with a long line!We were at Disneyland on Dec 31st so it closed at 5pm to get ready for their New Year's Eve event. We think it wasn't very crowded that day (max line was about 70 minutes when it could go up to 140 minutes on popular days) but it still felt crowded. Unfortunately, when we tried to use our fast pass for Big Thunder, it was temporarily closed so we decided to leave the park. On the way out, we saw the parade. Nice parade but nothing memorable. Of the 2 Tokyo Disney parks, I have to say that Disneysea is much more fun and different than Disneyland. That's the one we would return to.
Spending one day in this Tokyo Disneyland with some of the rides using Fast Pass was an absolutely fun !! We pick some rides that can be enjoyed by my son (6) : Peter Pan Flight, Star Wars Tour, Monster Inc, Space Mountain, Pooh, Snow White, Dumbo 😁👍🥳 and was closed by Evening Show in the famous castle 👍🥳
An amazing place to have fun, thrills or just relaxing and enjoying quality time with kids. Super clean atmosphere and fantastic staff who go out of their way to help you. I hope to return one day.
It's our 2nd time at Tokyo Disney, it's a lot more crowded compared to our visit last summer, minimum of 30min waiting time for the rides. The Christmas parade is awesome, very entertaining.
Tokyo disneyland has so far been the best disney park visited.  Although there is language barrier, they are always willing to help to solve your problems. The waiting queue is also systematic and good.  Safe to walk around even until the park close. Food is a bit expensive but that is all about theme park food prices.  Wonderful magical experience.  Suitable for family to play and also exciting rides for the adventurous.
I got a chance to visit Tokyo Disney, for only $37!! That’s right! After 6pm Tokyo Disney and DisneySea tickets go from regular admission price of $67 to half the price! During December they have amazing Christmas decor! I got to experience the Stitch Encounter,(Japanese ONLY) but still worth it! I didn’t understand what stitch was saying, but the simple fact that everyone else was laughing made this experience more fun! I laughed with everyone else, and thankfully I didn’t get selected to answer some of his silly questions! I ended my trip to Tokyo Disney with bags and bags of Disney goodies for my loved ones! Highly recommend a visit to both parks!
Visited with a one-day pass.Plus:  able to reserve/purchase tickets at 7-11. This is a MUST, really long lines at ticket booths on the day of. Save yourself an hour waiting in the cold/heat. Fast Passes available for two of our “high priority” rides. Nice covered Main Street. The famous Disney ambiance, right down to the spotless streets and Cast Members at every corner. Interestingly, there wasn’t a gift shop at the end of each major ride (like Anaheim), which was refreshing.Minuses:  super crowded! Don’t go during school vacations or you will wait at least an hour for every ride. Most popular rides had 150-180 minute waits. Most Fast Passes ran out by noon and shut down, so we only got 2 Fast Pass rides. Restaurants ditto, 20-80 minutes wait esp during meal times. Go during off-meal times. Download or get a map, layout is not very intuitive. Have fun!
Went on 4th Jan, was less crowded and enjoyed ourselves with our 2 year old for a full day. The resort makes it a point to habe non stoo entertainment and the service team is forever smiles. Love the vibe and we will be back!
"This is the worst Disneyland experience ever! The place is so crowded and there is a very long queue in every attraction; you have to wait at least an hour or so to see/ride one!!! Even the comfort rooms, restaurants, and shops have very long queues!!Definitely will not be coming back!"
"Have visited Disneyland Orlando, Anaheim and Hong Kong. I must say Tokyo Disneyland is the most crowded among those I have visited. I have read that Disneyland Tokyo can be very crowded; I bought a 3-day pass, look-up the crowd calendar and chose to visit from Tuesday to Thursday with the least crowd. But still, it is very crowded for all 3 days. I can't imagine if its a weekend.Tokyo Disneyland's character meeting & photo-taking is somehow different from other countries. Unless you are going to the ""official & proper"" character meet & greet located at their shack , the ""ad-hoc"" characters that pops up in the street doesn't have a proper queue. We see people crowding around the character and after a few times, we observed that there is no queue because the character picks the person to take picture with. So yah... wait for your turn to be picked. If you have kids, they will surely take a picture with you in no-time. All you need to do is call and wave at the character. Tokyo Disneyland has many strict rules to abide as well. While waiting for the night parade, we opened up our foldable director chair in one corner where there is nobody behind us, the disney staff came over and say no and asked us to keep it. On 2nd occasion, my 9yo gal who is not tall was asked by the disney staff to come down from the bench that she was standing while my gal was stretching her neck trying to catch a glimpse of the light show at Cinderella Castle with all the tall adults in front of her. *rolls eyes*If you have been to other Disneyland before and have limited time for theme parks, just go for Disneysea which can only be found in Tokyo."
We are Disney buffs and have visited the original Disneyland a couple of times at peak times near Christmas.We visited Disneyland Tokyo at the end of this December. We have mixed feelings. We definitely prefer the Disneyland at Anaheim due to the layout and atmosphere. What shocked us was the crowds. It was insane! Rides were nearly a 3 hour wait. We lined up for fast passes in between the rides we could get on ( not many) there are a variety of food choices and shows. We also went when it was freezing. So be prepared to line up in 6 degrees for an hour minimum. Due to the crowds we did not stay for the fireworks.If you are going to shop do it when a parade is on or midday NOT at night as you cannot move. It was clean and the staff were polite. Do not expect the staff to be able to speak English which really isn’t needed as there a plenty of signs in English.We can tick this Disneyland off. We enjoyed DisneySea better. We have Two teenagers. Disneyland is more suited for younger children.Try the different flavoured popcorns to eat while waiting in lines.
This was the first time I’ve ever been to any Disney park and I can’t wait to go back! The only thing I noticed was the characters that walked around seemed to avoid American children. I tried to get a picture with my girls and they just walked away.
Still the happiest place on earth. But always with lots of visitors so expect long lines and be patient. Or make use of the fast pass.
Came here for my daughter’s 5th birthday.We arrived about 1pm and surprised at how short the queue to enter at the front gate was (that was the shortest queue of the day!).When we arrived I noticed a couple of Disney characters there for photo opportunities - but we were keen to move on so didn’t stop. Bad move as we never saw any more the whole day (which disappointed my daughter).Tokyo Disneyland crowds are like NYE everywhere. Even the toilet queue was long.We heard about the Fast Pass option but unfortunately by the time we got there they were all sold out.We only ended up queuing for a few rides which took 40 minutes each (and lots of patience with little ones). Other rides such as It’s A Small World said their queue was close to 100 minutes.We went on Pirates of the Caribbean - and unfortunately the ride hasn’t changed much since I went to Disneyland 30 years ago.It’s a very expensive day out (especially with all the shops that you pass by and end up after every rude). And by the end the kids were tired and grumpy.In saying that - the kids still had a ball and have fond memories.Also a tip - if you are celebrating a birthday tell the staff and you’ll get a birthday sticker so everyone will say Happy Birthday to you - which made my daughters day.
This is the best Disneyland I have ever visited! The shows and the parades are superior. They include a lot of characters. A unique point in Disneyland is that you can inside the castle through Cinderella’s Fairy Tale Hall. It showcases Cinderella’s story. And I forgot my iphone x inside the toilet but luckily one of the disney staff return back to me.
While I realise we went during the week between xmas and New Years we arrived at the park at 8am and already the lines were 40 min plus long.  We got fast passes for splash mountain right away and got a time of 11:30am.  The next time we could get a fast pass was at 10:30m and we got a ride time of 3:30pm.   There were so many people and the lines were so long for everything the kids really didn't have that great of a time.  The staff was all very pleasant and happy but the lines were just too much.  Probably wouldn't go back
I know that we must have chosen one of the busiest days to go to Disneyland - Saturday over the December holidays -  we arrived at about 10am and it was already incredibly busy. The fast pass tickets for rides we coming in with return times for late afternoon / evening! The standby times on rides we at 90mins minimum and some up to 130mins.I felt terrible for my kids as I knew they would not get on many rides and would become impatient in the queues.By the end of he day we had gone on 2 rides and 1 simulator. We had to queue for everything - food lines, restaurants, popcorn, EVERYTHING was a wait.It is by far the worst experience at a theme park I have had. There was clearly too many people there than they could accommodate.If you are going for the rides, don’t bother. If you are going for the Disney experience then the place is clean and well maintained and the Disney characters roam the park for photo opportunities (but you have to queue for these too). Disappointing for the kids.
Still fun and enjoyable. Went gefiele Christmas. One special anniversary parade in the day, one Christmas special parade in the day and one night parade as well as the fireworks. Thrill rides for adults would be splash mountain, space mountain, big thunder. Disneyland more kids friendly and if you are into rides then Disney sea have more to offer. Do try their food, it’s good and price reasonable considering it to be in a theme park.
People were not kidding when they mention that Disneyland Tokyo is very crowded. The queue is always long but if we use the Fast Pass, it is not an issue. We went Disneyland Tokyo for 1 day and it was sufficient for us to cover all rides. However, we could not catch the shows and the parade. Partly because we went back to our hotel to eat because there was  no Halal food at Disneyland Tokyo. If we had not done that, we will be able to do more. As usual, the crowd was overwhelming at the parade. As such, we prefer to queue up for rides. Although the queue for the rides was long, it was constantly moving and even when we waited for an hour for some of the rides, the wait was surprisingly pleasant. Especially since we went during the cool winter time and not during the hot and humid summer. I can't wait to go back to Disneyland. Not just to bring my kids back there again.. but also for myself 😁
To start off, the subway station did not have clear instruction how to get there.   We need to ask around, try to figure out which is the subway line and goggle for info.  I am not sure why as this is a major attraction.The attraction is filled with people on a cold winter day.   Most attractions have to queue for at least from 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours.  Standing in the freezing temperature is quite unbearable.  So you can imagine how many rides one can take a day.  It is over-crowded.On a positive note, the staff made the rides interesting with their enthusiasm.   The place has very high maintenance standard.  This is clearly shown despite millions of people visiting it.I would recommend visiting the place not in winter.
Being a Disney Otaku, Tokyo Disneyland may be one of the best Disney Parks in Asia or in some case, one of the best Disney Parks in the world. I can't get over how tall and enchanting Cinderella's Castle is during the day or night. Before March 2019, it will be fantastic to visit Tokyo Disneyland as there is its 35th Happiest Celebration going on. The decorations and constantly updated food menu, are splendid, especially World Bazaar Celebration Street. There is an enormous photo op for anyone to take pictures with all the mickey statues from all of the anniversaries up till the 35th. During the day, every 10 to 15 minutes, the theme song for the 35th anniversary will play. And at night, classic disney musical films from the Disney Renaissance era, such as the Lion King and the Little Mermaid will be played beautifully throughout World Bazaar.One tip is if you target the popular rides, really do grab fastpasses at the fastpass machines near each fastpass attraction. For us, we grabbed the Monsters Inc Ride fastpasses at Tomorrowland and ran to Fantasyland to standby the ride for Pooh's Hunny Hunt. The fastpass would save you queuing time and it was worth for the Monsters Inc Ride.Something that was spectacular was the limited-time only 'Dreaming Up' Parade. Waiting for about an hour to get a promising view of the parade was worth the time. You can rest and also purchase cute and detailed snacks from the famous Sweetheart Cafe at World Bazaar while waiting. I would recommend you to watch the parade before March 2019 and if you know or at least like Disney characters. The song was mixed beautifully with other Disney film music and the parade floats. It was so addictive that you can sing the song inside your head. For Disney fans out there, it may make you cry of nostalgia as I did.
Childhood dream to visit Disneyland! We went on a Sun and the crowd wasn't as crazy as what we had thought. Crowds are mostly locals, surprising not many tourists on a Sun. A place that makes dream comes true! A pity that we didn't have time to take photo with any of the characters. Kind of sad thinking about it now. But we actually conquer quite a number of rides. The queue for the rides are quite manageable.All I could say was one day here is definitely not enough. Try to plan ahead by getting the fast pass to some of the rides as well as the lottery chance for the performance. F&B queue are definitely long and so we had to settle on something quick like a Mickey hand-shaped bun / giant turkey drumstick / snacking on popcorn from the Willy design bucket. Best ride which I enjoyed was definitely the roller coaster one.Basically a place that lets me open my wallet with a smile!
My partner and I visited Tokyo Disneyland yesterday. Being that the new year is upcoming it was busy but we expected it no matter the time of year. We found it amazing from the moment we walked through the entrance gates. I’ve read some reviews about complaints re: wait time for attractions... it’s Disneyland! You are going to need to wait, please don’t be surprised. My partner and I waited from 20-110minutes (most wait times about 30-45). Every attraction has a sign with expected wait time so you are pre warned. We did not ever have a wait time longer then what was on the sign, in fact most of them were quicker. Our most favourite attractions: Winnie The Poo, Thunder Mountain and It’s a Small World.There is food everywhere! We went to the Queen Of Hearts Banquet. You get a choice of what you put on your tray (Savoury and sweet) some of the sweets come with a cup and saucer to keep! It was very well priced as well. We spent from 9:30am-9pm there, make sure you stay for the fireworks (8:30pm) and try and watch a parade (usually after dark), you will see people sitting down waiting. Truly an amazing place and a must see! We only did one day and that was enough for us (we are incredibly officiant with time and do not like sitting down too long, so if you want to relax through your time there maybe do more than one day).
Tokyo Disney is a theme park entirely based on the films produced by Walt Disney!Opened in 1983, the Japanese park had the privilege of being the first outside the United States.Today it is already the third most visited park in the world.In Japan there are two parks side by side: Tokyo Disney and Tokyo DisneySea!The first was done in the mold of Disneyland in California and the Magic Kingdom in Florida.Disney is divided into 7 worlds or theme lands.It goes from the western / western old style to the extreme future with Star Wars.From the drinking fountains, trash bins and warning signs.In a few minutes you will be totally immersed in the experience and surely you will spend a day that you will completely forget about the real world!
When you go to tokyo for a vacation then you shouldn't miss disneyland especially if you have children. Staff in disney were one of the best accomodating to visitors. The parade was breathtaking and also the fireworks. I love it so much despite the cold weather.
Visited on Dec 18, there were lots of people even though it was a weekday. Make sure to get a fast pass at the Monsters Inc. ride and Space Mountain or else you'll have to wait for 90 mins. Lines in most rides are very long (60-90 min wait time) so Fast Pass and Single Rider are your best friends, make sure to make good use of them so you can enjoy all the rides in the park. Thunder Mountain Railroad is way better than Disneyland Hollywood. It's my favorite Disney ride ever and the one in Tokyo is at par with Hong Kong's, in my opinion. Classic rides such as Splash Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, Peter Pan, It's A Small World are a must. You can ride Jungle Cruise at night for a different feel. Star Tours have zero line so ride it anytime.They check the bags upon entry but didn't say anything when they saw the snacks we brought. Bring a water bottle too so you can refill them in the park.
Going here with family during vacation in November 2018. The park is fully loaded, several attraction were not be able to play since the queuing is very long. Fast pass might possible however the queuing process it self required some process which might ended in the hour that may not suit with the schedule. However worth it to try and enjoy the park until night since so many attraction which very attractive. Suggest to enter the park early in the morning so that we can enjoy the park until night.
Tokyo Disney land, similar to other Disneylands, are suitable for younger kids, the queues are horrendously long for everything, from rides to restaurants to... pop corn stations! Yes your eyes are not playing trick on you, I wrote pop corn stations! And guess what? The longest queue isn’t for the rides, it’s for all the carts selling unique pop corn holders! Japanese has made such great merchandisers that every pop corn station has their own unique holders, where you cannot hope to get the same one again after you leave that particular stations.. so in the end, everybody queue! And awesome design and merchandise they have made indeed, you feel like buying the whole Disneyland home! Kid you not, this place is more for shopping than for rides...
We managed to get into the rides even though there is a Q. Being first timer there, we didn’t do any homework nor bothered how express pass works, we managed to get on many rides with the kids. Weather is cold so do bring enough to keep warm.
It rained almost the entire day which made waiting in long lines quite unpleasant. The long queues were everywhere. Can't believe even with Fast Pass, we waited like 5 hrs for a 3 min ride! I'm thinking it's the last theme park for me. Some of the rides were very good, like the Pirates of the Carribean and the classic It's a Small World. Would have gone for more rounds had it not been the long queues everywhere.
After our very long day at Disneysea, we headed to Tokyo Disneyland the very next morning at 8am. And long lines were already formed when we arrived! We thought we arrived early but no! So we managed to enter the park at 8.30am.Went to get the first fastpass- Monsters ride before heading to the Star Tours (5 min wait). Then we went to Toontown for Gadget's Go Coaster (15 mins wait) and waited for 55 mins for a picture with Mickey. Seems stupid for the long wait but I'm so happy to be able to get a photo with him. Then, we headed to Fantasyland for It's A Small World (20 mins wait)- still my favourite after visiting HK's Small World in Disneyland. I went to check the waiting times for the rides through the app and noticed Small World's waiting time was rather short so i dont think there's no need to get the fast pass for Small World. Go get fast pass for Space/Splash mountain or Big Thunder Mountain.Food was rather average or downright bad.  Luckily we ate at 11am/11.30am- when we went out alot of people were waiting outside! Gosh! (and we also had difficulties finding an empty table)Took a stroll around Westernland next and went for Country Bear Theater but I almost fell asleep because I couldn't understand their language and what are they talking about- same goes to Disneysea but at least I understand the plot and songs) and all staff spoke in Japanese. I think English is also required because not only Japanese visit Disneyland- people from all over the world visit too. It would be best if they provide English Language as well.Managed to get a fast pass for Space Mountain and we went for the ride. I like how they had exits for those who decided not to ride the ride. Space Mountain was thrilling and fun.You can't miss Dreaming Up (parade) there because all your favourite characters will be appearing, transporting you back to your childhood dreams and memories.  I really love the parade and I hope you all will too. We rode the Monsters Ride after that.We queued for around 45 mins for the Pooh Hunny Hunt- amazing trackless ride and it spins and turns- so fun!  We headed to Mickey's PhilarMagic afterwards before watching the fantabulous Celebrate! Tokyo Disneyland for Disney's 35th Anniversary and WORDS CAN'T EXPRESS how amazing it was. It was though magic just happened in front of your eyes. you MUST watch this spectacular performance during this limited period of time. After the performance, we went in souvenir shops and bought more things than in Disneysea (oops!)Wanted to catch the Brand New Dream fireworks at 8.30pm thus we went out to Ikspiari for dinner (there is a very big Disney store!) before going back to Disneyland for a 4 min fireworks that start punctualy at 8.30pm. After a very long day at Disneyland, we bid goodbye and left reluctantly.. We really enjoyed Tokyo Disneyland and finally, had Tokyo Disneyland checked off my list.
I know it’s Christmas Day and all and queues are usually long but waiting for 2.5hrs for a 1min ride is ridiculous. Fast track wasn’t much help either. I understand why, but you couldn’t book another session until 2hrs had passes since you requested a previous fast track. The thing was our first one at 10:55 gave us a time slot at 18:55 and we couldn’t go fast track on another ride until 12:55 and all the rides had really long queues...even the food places.It is always nice to see Disney but I was disappointed I couldn’t embrace the fun stuff and be bring out my inner child again. I don’t think I’ll be back.
My 3,5 years old boy could enter the park for free (kids under 4yrs free) and he was tall enough to get the blue wristband (toddlers with height more than 102cm) so he was so happy he could do all the cool rides with his older brother (6yrs old).If you are staying few days in Tokyo, I suggest to check the weather forecast once you arrived and decide the nicest day to go to Disneyland (It was raining the whole day when we arrived at Tokyo Bay where we stayed, got so lucky the next day was dry despite cloudy).Make sure you browse in advance the map and tips & tricks for Disneyland/ Disneysea. Pre-arrange who will do the fastpass hunting as it will totally help the kids (and yourself) to be able to enjoy the park at most. Tips:I literary do the sprint run along bunch of Japanese teenagers once the gate is open (dont forget to bring all the tickets as you need to scan the ticket to get the Fastpass). While you do the hunting, kids and your partner can just stroll nicely to the toontown (minor queus perfect for the young toddlers).The fastpass machine tickets are located at each areas (you can browse further about this). I ran to Tomorrowland and got the 1st FP for the Space Mountain. Check your FP timeline and remember the window time (at the bottom you can see when you are allowed to get another FP). *The most popular queue on our visit was the Pooh’s Hunny Hunt. By 12am the FP machine was already closed and the normal queu was enormous. So, if you really want to ride this one, you might want to run first to Fantasyland to get the FP. I got in total 6x FP (2x Space Mountain, 2x Buzzlightyear, 2x Splash Mountain, 1x Star Tours).*Star Tours queue was not so bad around 5pm so might keep this ride for the latest. *Don’t miss the fireworks and lights show on the closing time!
A fabulous Disneyland.Busy but that’s Tokyo.Food prices were reasonable.Easy to get to from Tokyo.Would recommend
Awesome superb. One can always become a child at any age 😁 we made a second trip just to meet mickey mouse whom we missed the first day. Best option is to buy fast track tickets rather than wait in 2hr queues. for fast track too register your names at entrances for timings. Register for 3-4 at a time and visit the rides then. Xmas shows and parades are a must but not to forget to carry some mat or fleece blankets as you are required to sit on floors for hours for the shows and parades. They don't allow u to stand.
Tokyo Disneyland is a wonderful place. Crowded but if you do your research and strategy, choose the rides and use FastPass, you will enjoy the day. Go early 30-60 mins before the park open to queue. We manage to get 4 FastPass and did most of the rides by 5pm even when it’s very crowded. Bring your own food and don’t waste time queuing at restaurant. Can eat in the park. Even churros stand has a queue, but we queued for that as it’s not such a long wait. There are water cooler to refill water. Definitely a must if you enjoy Disney.
Crowded everywhere, stalls, ticket counters, washroom, restaurants. I didn’t enjoy here well, one game have to queue up minimum half an hour and some of the game have to wait for few hours. I saw people everywhere.
This has to be 1 of the best Disneys. Immaculate Service all round and the attention to details is just amazing. The energy level displayed by all staff is unbelievable. Yes it is crowded but it is organised chaos. Use the Fast Pass! It is there for a reason. Stay for the Parade n just enjoy the atmosphere.
This had the worst queue in Disneyland!! I visited 3 disney and this Disneyland is about queuing n queuing. Even for food you will need to queue for 45 mins. It simply way too time wasting. Place wise is great and huge are compare to hongkong. Ambience is good with Christmas feel. Remember to get fast pass tickets if not it will take 3 hours to queue for a ride.
A beautiful park. Yes it gets busy. Go on a week day if you want less of a crowd however it will still be busy. Space mountain and Big Thunder rail road are popular consider using fast pass. Poohs hunny hunt is also extremely popular so a fast pass is recommended. People will wait for long periods of time to reserve seating for parades and shows. Disney attire is popular at this park. Restaurants book out quickly so book on line before visiting if possible however this is in Japanese only. Lots of food and drink options available. Currently decorated for Christmas. Christmas special food options are available at the moment.
The queues are long and it’s generally crowded but if you’re patient and with kids who are willing to wait, it’s a magical place. Use the fast pass where possible.  The night parade is outstanding and worthwhile to catch. The food at the restaurants are definitely better than the food at Disney World or Disneyland Paris.
We were here the first week of December and having all the Christmas decorations and parades made the experience just that much more spectacular. We spent 4 days at the parks. When you stay at the Disney Hotels, you’re able to buy park tickets that allow you to hop between parks from day 1 as well as 15 minute early entry into the parks. This early entry allowed us to get Fastpasses and que for rides well before the huge crowds entered the parks. It was also a great time to get your photos without people in the way. Do your research before you go on how the parks work and what rides are the most popular. Overall we enjoyed the parks just as much as Anaheim and Disney World. The Cast Members were brilliant and most spoke a bit of English so with our limited Japanese, communication wasn’t a problem. Highly recommend! Something for everyone.
To skip the line on the entry gate, its highly recomended for you to purchase the ticket in advance. And make sure to keep the ticket since you will need that to get the FASTPASS.First, once you enter the park, just go directly to the Fastpass machine as soon as possible to get the ticket for the favourite rides. after you collect the Fastpass ticket, then you can enjoy the other rides that do not provide the Fastpass  ticket.This is how you skip the waiting line and enjoy the park as much as possible.If you do not into some parades, just skip it as well, since it will takes about 1 hour (or more) for you to wait and keep the seat on the street. You really need to manage your time well spent to maximize all the rides in Tokyo Disneyland. Considering that in the regular time (weekdays and not peak season) the park itself can be very very crowded.Do some research before visit the park, you can browse the Tokyo Disneyland official website to choose which rides that you wish to play include the park maps.have fun!!
First time stepping to Tokyo, so it’s a must to visit tokyo disneyland... I was amazed the moment i step into the disneyland.. It was amazing & i love the parade...The next time i visit japan, i would to go to the disney sea...
The most crowded day that we had ever visited the park but surprisingly it was in an orderly way.  We bought a lot of the anniversary items.
Visited disnyeland during the rest of winther is the best choice i had, because i dont have to worry about sweating all day long💚
The happiest place to be. So many things to do like the rides, parades, and attractions. Food is below average and expensive. So many theme areas. You cannot ride all the roller coasters in one day. It takes 30 minutes to wait for each ride. There were 3-4 parades. The best was the Electrical Light Parade in the evening. So many Japanese tourists even if it was a weekday and drizzling.
All you can are happy faces. Students are in group wear Disney accessories. Have to bear the long lines for the rides as well as the restaurants.
This place is much bigger than the HKG disneyland. So you will need 1 to 2 days at least to go around the park if you are going to try for all the rides.However, it is super crowded. One thing to point out though, everyone knows how to queue and there is not cutting of queues. The crowd although alot, but they do not push you around. Kids will love this place. However, note that the language is only in Japanese.
I went with a friend during Halloween Week but despite the crowd, we had a blast. We were there ALLLLL day and we got to do most of the rides and attractions. Because of the crowds, the lines were a bit long but hey it’s DisneyLand - it’s expected. The souvenirs were a bit pricey but again, expected. It really was a good day. One thing I was a bit sad about was that I didn’t get to see most of the characters but it seemed they were busy for the special Halloween parade.
Disney Tokyo lived up to my families expectations and probably exceeded them. We arrived at the park at 0825 on a Tuesday and already lines were lengthening for the 0900 opening. We already had our entrance tickets so it didn't take too long to enter the park once that gates opened. As advised we headed straight for the fast pass for the Pooh ride. At that time there was already a long line waiting to get a fast pass. We got other fast passes during the day but unfortunately several clashed with the parades. We ate at Tomorrowland dinner the foud was basic but reasonably priced. By being selective we were able to complete 15 rides in the day waiting no more than 20 minutes for any ride. We took in two parades the best being the evening Electric Parade which was spectacular. You need to claim a good seating spot at least an hour before the parade commences. We started our adventure at 0900 and left the park at 2230. Both the 11-year-old and the 18-year-old stated that it was the happiest day of their lives and that says it all.
They sell more tickets than the park could take. Everywhere you go is crowded, from main entrance to attractions, restaurants to even toilets. People everywhere. You need to queue to get a fast pass to beat the queue. Otherwise, expect to wait in line for up to 2 hours. On that day I was there, they cancelled the fireworks show on a clear and cloudless evening. Maybe Disney felt that their ticket takings for the day was insufficient to cover the cost of fireworks. If a 6 year old child said it is no fun, this place is indeed not worth the money and time.
Went to Tokyo Disneyland in early June, and it was great. First and foremost, it's cheaper than the American Disneyland. For less than $70, you can have an amazing time. The park is actually on a larger tract of land than Anaheim, but there are a handful less rides- meaning the rides are spaced out nicely, and not congested.The park was busy, but not that busy. We used Fast Pass on a lot, and I think the average wait time was about 15-20 minutes. One ride that was super popular was a crazy wait, like 3-4 hours, so we skipped it. There are various Disney characters running around, so it was fun for my toddler to try and get a photo with them. One other major comparison and observation was how reasonable food and drink is at Tokyo Disneyland. In the States, they get you for all you got when it comes to food and drink. In Tokyo, prices are no higher than they would be at any other store. Drinks are about the same as they would be at 711.We went to a restaurant and I had a steak for $12. That would be unheard of in the States. Tokyo Disneyland is super clean, and like just about everywhere else in Japan, super efficient, with impeccable customer service. There are many things to do and ride even for a 2 year old. Of course the options will increase as the age does, but I am glad we went, as my daughter STILL talks about it and remembers how fun it was. So forget when people tell you that your kid won't remember anything. Can't wait to go back. I think it may become an annual thing when we are in Japan.
Disneyland will have you smiling all day no matter what age you are. The Mickey Mouse shaped food is delicious. The Disney castle and the different themed areas are amazing to look at and take photos of. The only downside is lining up for rides which can take over an hour because the park is always busy. I was there during Halloween and the whole park had pumpkins and other decor which looked amazing.
We are mad Disney fans and thought long and hard before visiting this US icon in Japan. We have been to Hong Kong a few times and it just falls way short of expectations and before we visited here we heard mixed reports. I will start by saying if you are looking for an exact replica of the US Disney offerings you will be disappointed as there are some very unique differences. Those differences include Main Street USA is replaced by the Bizarre which still offers an array of great shops but it is different. Once you get past the Bizarre then it is more like the US offerings...... but spoken in Japanese. The park is super clean, cleaner than anything in the US and what really took our breath away was the quality of food. No you won’t find a turkey leg and there is a mix of US style foods and Japanese food but they are superbly done and of a high quality. The other notable difference is the Japanese love for flavoured popcorn and popcorn buckets which they carry around like a fashion accessories. Chocolate, caramel, soy sauce and salt are just 3 of the some dozen or so flavours and the buckets we have seen included, Steamboat Willie, Olaf, Lightning McQueen, Stitch, Cinderella’s carriage, Chip and Dale, Mickey and Minnie’s bow. Some of the attractions are better than the US Disneys too. The Haunted Mansion The Nightmare Before Christmas is much better either Disneyland or Disney World. The beginning of the Pirates of the Caribbean is better and Space Mountain is slightly different. There are some unique items to Tokyo Disney as well - the Pooh rise and the Monster’s inc ride are only at Tokyo. But here is the issue. Many of the rides are spoken in Japanese. We know what is going on only because of our frequent visits to the US. It may be a deal breaker for many people though and having read some of the reviews here, I see many people struggled with this. Also the merchandise is different. There are not a lot of T-shirts and those they have are limited. Most of the merchandise is food related and we enjoyed this aspect but I know many won’t. We loved this park and it was like discovering a Disney park all over again. It is very well organised and clean and as I said earlier the food is great.We will be back and loved it.
We tried not to go there on weekends, so we chose to visit on a Monday. The queues for all the rides were still very long. Even though we didn’t manage to go on many rides or shows, we still enjoyed ourselves very much. Just being inside the theme park itself was already enough to make us happy.  The atmosphere was wonderful. Oh and the shopping! We love Disney so we spent a lot on the merchandise - cookies, chocolates and souvenirs. Last but not least, we were so impressed with the staff. EVERYONE of them was friendly and looked happy.  They were all so polite.  The Japanese take pride in their jobs.  They made our visit even more pleasant and memorable. I didn’t give it a full rating only because of the long queues for the rides.
Took the dragonboat in which the operator who spoke only in Japanese throughout the ride without giving due consideration to the foreign tourists. There wasnt much engagement with non-Japanese visitors.
Check crowd calendar to be sure you don’t buy tickets on crazy crowded days. Everyone’s said it but it bears repeating: FASTPASS is your friend. Get your game plan on and know which are your must-do rides. Get FP for 1st must-do ride, then queue for your 2nd must-do.I’d advise you to familiarise yourself with the map prior to the trip so that you know exactly where your desired attractions are at which land. Pro-tip: at ToonTown, go to the merchandise shop and you will see a vending machine that dispenses unique Mickey Mouse in baubles. 500yen a try. Guaranteed win and fun! Also plan ahead which food items you want to have and know where they are- if you wing it, you might be too full when you chance upon another cutesy themed food item. Wear comfortable shoes. I went alone so I had my power bank and Netflix shows downloaded for the queues. People watching is fun around the Parks cos they’re mostly dressed up but not in a queue where you see the same people. So unless you have good company, go prepared.The toilets have those machines that play water sounds ... very Japanese. As an English-speaker, I enjoyed Big Band Beat which was a jazz English show (great tap dancers!)
Loved my time here, it's do-able in one day. It's so nice out here but definitely have to do Disney Sea while you're here!
If you had one day at the Tokyo Disney Resort, I wouldn’t suggest going to this park. Instead I would recommend going to Disneysea instead, it’s a much better park. Having said that Tokyo Disneyland is a very good Disney park. 90% of the park is great and really fun. The 10% that doesn’t really work is Adventure Land.Adventure land is a mishmash or random classic Disney attractions smashed together with a very vague theme. Many of the rides are fine, but how they connect to each other doesn’t make any sense at all. The railroad, also found at Adventure Land, is one of the most disappointing trains in all of the castle parks. The main difference is that the train doesn’t stop anywhere else except the Adventure Land station. So while it’s a fun ride, it lacks the usability of the trains at other parks.When we visited there was a lot of construction going on, but other than a huge wall connecting Toon Town (our favourite land) and Tomorrow Land it was fairly unobtrusive.
"This Disney resort is fantastic for Disney fans of all ages!  Cast Member service is truly excellent.  Souvenirs are particularly well-made and worth buying compared to the offerings at Disneyland (Anaheim) and Disney World (Orlando).  If you have young ones (especially little girls), I HIGHLY suggest the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall for lunch or dinner.  It is truly a must-see dining experience with an option to purchase unique collectible stoneware.  Restroom facilities are immaculately clean throughout the park.  Also be on the lookout for unique collectible popcorn buckets throughout the various flavored popcorn stations.  Also, the Pooh's Hunny Hunt trackless ride is absolutely phenomenal and should not be missed.Some glaring issues are:1. Japan doesn't have an ADA compliance equivalency, so wheelchairs and strollers may have a difficult time navigating some areas.  2.  The painted concrete ""cobblestone"" areas are ridiculously hard, uncomfortable, and aesthetically ugly.  Disney should have paid for either real cobblestone or smooth concrete."
A kids paradise, my wife and kids enjoyed it a lot. Rides were fun, place was spacious and they were tons of people. Staff and people were friendly. Nothing to complain about. Things i were to complain would be the food and long waiting time. Food was expensive and may not be good to have - kind of boring. Queues were long but kind of expected. Fast pass was limited. Definitely better than Disney Sea. Would come again.
I'm not so impressed.(PS: It was my childhood dream, and I know that my third-grade self would be very happy.)I only recommend Tokyo Disneyland if you really have free time. However, for beginners and first-timers, this is so far the child-friendliest Disney park I would ever recommend.It's number of guests do compete with Metro Manila and Bangkok traffic congestions combined hehehe.
This park is very spacious and when I went it looked like they were expanding. The Christmas parade was nice and the electrical parade was a little different but very nice as well. This park also has a lot of delicious treats as well as different attractions. Pooh's Honey Hunt was a very nice and different ride and is very popular. The lines to get into this park are also very long at park opening! The stores are also very busy, particularly at night making it hard to get around. The Haunted Mansion seems very similar to the one in Florida but at the time I went it was decked out for the holidays with Nightmare Before Christmas, this arrangement was very unique and enjoyable! The castle projection show was also very nice.
The management let too many people in the park out of greed. Its nearly impossible to take any ride (I manage to get 2 ride (which lasted 5 mins) for the whole day (arrive at 11am).Even going to the toilet (for guys ) need to queue ? I am being honest to share with all of you, unless you have too much free time and nothing better to do, please do not come to Tokyo Disneyland.Hongkong Disneyland in my opinion is a must better option in term of efficiency. The management have the cheek to tell me that everyone is queuing and waited for hours for a ride. My reply would be, why does everyone accept poor services make it right? Money is better and elsewhere like Shibuya or Shinjuku.
This is my 4th Disneyland and I have to say, it is one of my favorites! Disneyland always makes you feel like a kid again. My children LOVED IT! And that was a great thing for us. The place was so clean and well maintained. Staff was polite as usual (for most Japanese that we encountered). They make sure that during the parades everyone will be able to see it. The only downside about this Disneyland is that they don't have the badges that the other Disneyland provides.
"We visited the park in October. While walking around the park, I lost my teddy bear. It was a gift that I received more than 10 years ago and that I was used to take with me when travelling. I couldn’t believe to have lost it!!My husband decided to go to the lost and found, hoping that someone would have been so kind to return it. The customer service was extremely nice. Other people would have laughed at an adult looking for a lost teddy bear; instead they took our claim seriously and requested a much details as possible.A month after, my teddy bear is back! They sent it all the way to Australia...we couldn’t believe when we opened the parcel!!!Disney is truely the happiest place on Earth!!Thanks again :)"
This is the 2nd Disneyland I've visited after HK. LOVE IT. Everybody is so polite. I love the atmosphere. All the sounds and music will make you feel like you are propelled back to childhood where everything is wonderful and imaginative.When we went in Sep-18, it pretty much rained the the whole afternoon. Nonetheless, I love how the park had prepared a contingency parade for rainy day. Thankfully though, we caught the morning parade as well and saw human dances other than the passing floats. Also, try all the popcorns! :D
"Please visit! This Disneyland is unlike any, I took my wife (her first time) and it was truly a dream come true for her. One employee gave her a ""My first ride"" and ""My first time"", she was even given a key necklace! Food is expensive, as expected, but it's part of the experience. They offer a loop train around he park, about 600¥ day pass which is fine. I would highly suggest this visit, it's a totally different experience. PLEASE NOTE: everything is in Japanese."
"As a Disney fan, we couldn't pass up a trip to Tokyo Disney. Yes, it is different than what American's are used to, but it does have the Disney magic, with just enough familiar to blend with the new.  Living overseas for a year, we just couldn't miss an opportunity to visit another Disney park.  We enjoyed our time here at DisneyLand.  It is crowded, but just know where you want to go and what you want to do and be prepared to wait in a line or two.  Just let go, have fun and enjoy.    I really only have 3 complaints:1) the rides are tiny; built for the smaller Asian community.  My family is tall so there were a few rides we were all smashed in to.  My husband was almost denied entrance to ride space mountain.  We have no issues in the states, but there was very little wiggle room on this ride and splash mountain.  No room for long legs at all.  Monsters Inc was also a tight fit; a really tight fit!2) Fast passes.  You can only get fast passes at the ride you want to fast pass, so people enter the park and go directly to the ride they want to fast pass, then you have to wait to use it.  You can get your second one at the same time you can use your first one, so you are off to that ride to grab the pass then back to use the first one.  They need to make it so you can get a fast pass for any ride at kiosks instead of having to go all over the park to specific rides.  Much easier in the states.3) Park entrance tickets are not so easy to get.  You cannot order them from outside Japan as the resort does not accept credit card orders outside of Japan.  You can purchase open date tickets from 3rd parties, but you are NOT guaranteed entrance to the park.  During peak times, they may deny entrance if the park is crowded. These wont have dates on them. If you are staying at a Disney hotel you can get dated tickets at the front desk.  Otherwise you'll have to wait in line at the park to purchase tickets.Even with the few exceptions, we really enjoyed our time in the park.  There are many of the familiar DisneyLand rides.  It was Halloween time, so the park was decorated nice.  The majority of people visiting were all dressed up so it was fun to people watch. We enjoyed the Spooky Boo Parade.   I like how you have to sit along the parade route a few rows deep so many can view it along the route.  You are also not allowed to have kids on your shoulders.  The Electric Light Parade was amazing and the best I've seen at any park. It's always best to stick around for the light show on the castle and the fireworks.  As Disney fans we were not disappointed with our visit.Ask if you have any specific questions.  If you are in Tokyo and you can make time, visit the parks.  It is worth it.  DisneySea is amazing as well."
While planning to visit Disneyland , its better to  Pre book the tickets to avoid long queues  we reached at 10 , which is considered late since the park opens at 8 Am and it was already packed by the time we reached .Its better to get your fast pass earlier on or else the wait on a crowded day is around 120 mins for the good rides also its better to avoid the week end , beter visit during the  weekdays if possible.Since we visited in October which was close to Halloween the People were dresse dup as their favourite characters , there are shops that provide the dress hair and make up for extra charge.Not to be missed the fireworks in the evening and the Parades all are good .Splash Mountain not to be missed .Since you can get only 4 fast passe choose wisely.We however spent all day but it was not possible to cover the whole park as there is so much to see.the gift shops are expensive For food there are separate Kiosks selling only certain items , like one would sell only BLT coffee etcBe prepared to walk a lot  and it going to be a long dayAlthough we left the park around 9.pm we did not cover the whole thing .Definately recommend going.
We arrived at 8am with a pre bought ticket. We got in straight away. Instead of turning right like everyone else we turned left and went to adventure land. Hardly anyone was there. We got our fast pass to Thunder Mountain. We spent nearly 2 hours in that area and got onto everything that we wanted to do. Using the Fast Pass  was great. Even though there were lots of people there we ended up  doing everything we wanted to. The parades were excellent. We did not dress in the same clothes as is the fashion. We spent 12 hours there before rain came. Definately recommend going.
what a day, you could easily spend more than one day.  heaps for the young, old and young at heart.  if you don't like the adrenaline rush rides there are plenty of other rides and sights to see.  long waiting period for rides.  great parades and the light shows at dusk are breath taking.  a must to go, be prepared for a long day
Great tourism place for family, lots of fun and beautiful evening show. Fireworks and the Disney show melt my heart.
If a ride lasts one minute it is worth one minute of my time to wait in line. Not an hour.And this was on a weekday in November. What anyone would spend the time to travel to Disneyland, wait in line for admission and then wait for a ride is beyond me.Give it a pass and ave the money.
Love Love Love. Don’t forget fast pass. Avoid national holidays as it’s busier then usual but regardless it’s full on with tourists of all nations. We stayed from 8.30am to 10.30pm.
The theme park itself was full of amazing attractions for both kids and adults.  Better make good use of their fast pass system to go on more rides.  Parades were good, fireworks was good and staff was really nice!  My daughter aged 6 liked the Monsters Inc ride the most and we managed to go on it twice even we had to be in line for around 45 mins for our second time.  Strongly recommend to stay at a hotel near the park so you can get to the park early in the morning and also have a place to rest nearby after you leave the park.  Was a pity I was going to reserve one of the diner shows in the park but the system was really a hassle to get into.  Will try again when we go next time. 樂園內有很多很有禮貌的本地人也有遊客, 大家很有秩序, 氣氛也很好! 真是一個到東京不可錯過的地方!  我們一定會再來!
A group of coworkers convinced me to go to Japan for a few days for my birthday and I spent the only full day we had at Disney. As a huge Disney fan I was not disappointed. The Haunted Mansion broke down on us, big surprise, and we were offers a free fast pass to any ride. I opted to keep the voucher as a souvenir since that was one of the last rides for us. I would highly recommend to anyone in Japan for a few days.
Excellent day in Tokyo Disneyland. An experience that brings joy to everyone 💕Good food at the restaurants, sometimes pricey, but worth the experience.Get there early, 2 hours, before opening. Expect thousands of people standing in line at 7.00 o’clock. Bring some snacks and drinks for the waiting.Buy the tickets in advance and grab the map as soon as you enter the park. Good to know where the restrooms are 👍🏻Use comfortable shoes! A lot of walking!
I've heard Tokyo Disneyland horror stories about the crowd and wait hours for the rides so we came prepared. I'm glad to say we were able to go on 8 rides and attractions and we could have done more if we didn't rest and snack as much. Tip 1: Always check the crowd calendar to choose the best date for your visit.Tip 2: Go on a weekday. We went on a Friday and the lines were manageable. Tip 3: Maximize your fast passes. First thing to do after park entry is get your first fast pass. Don't go on a ride yet. Efficiency is a must for this park. Same advice for your next fast passes - if it's already time for your next fastpass, get it first before doing anything else. Tip 4: Do Pirates of the Caribbean and Star Wars while waiting for your fastpass rides.  The lines here are short and quick but the attractions are more than decent. They're fun. Don't let the lines or lack thereof fool you.Tip 5: Wear something weird or cute for a more fun experience. You won't stand out.Tip 5: Skip Philharmagic. It was a bit of a drag.Tip 6: If you want to try the famous Disney popcorn and not particular as to flavor, get the soy-flavored ones outside Star Wars. I never saw a queue there. It actually was very good but, of course, the caramel-flavored ones were so much better.Tip 7: If you run out of fastpasses, go on the standby queues during parade hours. Most people would be watching the parade then. Tip 8: Find a good spot for the night parade at least an hour before.
Everything felt magical, starting from you ride the train to go there. And when you reach there, you will be welcomed by endless Disney songs.
Wow, The most Magical place on Earth is also in Japan, Its cleaner, Its bigger (compared to Original) Its just so beautiful. The food is different, in taste, style & presentation is to die for.
Not my first time but the first with my whole family who loved the experience. It is the best Disneyland in the world, in my opinion. Good food (on the pricey side, but worth it), good shows, good attractions. Stay for the evening parade and fireworks (weather permitting).
Tokyo Disneyland is very affordable in comparison to Disneyland in Anaheim, for two adult tickets we paid $132.00 (which is the price of one ticket in California.) The fastpasses are pretty much completely out by 11 am on the busy days. On average the ride wait times are between 80-120 minutes. There are people everywhere! It is insane. The food is very affordable, less than $3.50 for a small popcorn, less than $10 for a hot dog meal and churros are only like $2.
This is a miniature version of Disneyland, a poor copy. There are not many rides, events or things to do. The Disney character just stand around and wave since they cannot speak English. It is a very disappoint park if you are not Japanese
Entered the park before 9am and picked up our first fast past at 9:10, the slot was for 10:45. Walked to another ride and was there at 9:20. Waiting time 100 minutes ..... waited 85 mins and finally go in the ride. This continued all day.One fast pass I got at 13:00 showed the slot at 20:15hrs.... Not sure if this is a mistake? 30 minute Q for popcorn, 10 minute Q for toilets.... come on Disney......Bottom line, great staff and a clean park but to get only 4 rides on the day we visited..... poor.
I enjoy visiting there a lot . All the costumes characters felt realistic . It’s colourful and there is a lot of things to do. But, most of the food is not very good . But, I recommend the Mickey Mouse ice cream sandwich and caramel pop corn . I do not like - curry pop corn , Captain Hook pizza , crystal palace , queen of heart  .
Ok..  Anaheim Disneyland is the originators, that cannot be helped.  But Tokyo Disneyland perfected the system.  Ok I admit, Tokyo Disneyland doesn’t have Marvel and Star Wars themed in it but I doesn’t matter to me.  Here’s the advantage:    1.  Price:  2 parks for around $140!!  In Anaheim that’s 1 park alone!  Ok, there’s no park hopper pass, no big deal.  On top of that, food and merch is waaaaayyy cheaper.  2.  Space:  At Anaheim, there’s a bottle neck right after the entry to the park.  Tokyo, has a little bottle beck but there is significant space.  3.  Specialty Popcorn:  curry popcorn?  What?!  4.  Staff:  So professional and helpful.  Yes, there might a bit of a language barrier but they’ll make sure that you are served right.  Not to mention that they have an awesome system when working the parades.  5.  The Atmosphere:  I’ll just say this.  The people that go to Disneyland are so into it.  They dress for the occasion!  Ok..  it may have been in October but they know how to get into the spirit like majorly.  Not to mention that they participate so well during parades and they also sit down so the people in the back can watch as well.  You don’t get that anywhere.I’ll come to Tokyo Disneyland before Anaheim any day.
This was our first Disneyland and the family's excitement was beyond words. We spend the whole day exploring the place but it was not enough. The park is huge. We also loved the pop-corn and spend a lot of time and money in those gift shops.
Japan’s Disney resort is frankly a notch above the rest. In part because of their culture, and local population which simply makes visiting their parks such an enjoyable experience. Downside of course is everything is in Japanese. 😅During Halloween, a lot of visitors come in costume, which adds to the atmosphere and fun.Pro tip for rides, grab the fast pass for the popular rides like Winnie the Pooh first thing you enter. Simply enjoy the park and parades during the day, ride queues considerably shorten after 8pm, mainly as families with young kids would have left by then. But if you are visiting during school holidays when teenagers are the bulk...Shopping doesn’t close until the last visitor has left, so if you do not want to go around with a big bag of shopping, leave that for the last when you are leaving. Do note that some merchandise may be available only in certain locations though.
Tokyo Disneyland delivers on the Disney magic and does not disappoint.  Tokyo Disneyland is easily to access with a short train trip from Tokyo Station.The park has all the signs etc in English so you wouldn’t get lost/confused.  The staff are super helpful and friendly too.
what to say always good to visit disneyland this was out 3rd one in the world and i assume was great crowded as always and as usual huge line to the attractions but was really good . just missed some things in the stores that Paris disney and hong kong have much more different items.
"If you are a Disney fan, you will love Tokyo Disneyland.  So much is familiar, yet different at the same time. The attractions, of course, are amazing. I did not understand why Pooh's Honey Hunt was the biggest attraction... until I rode it!  (seriously, do not miss this one, even if like us, you have no small children in tow). The ""Dreaming Up"" parade was so magical that this former Disneyland cast member cried... and ended up buying the audio CD!"
"You will have fun all the day. First you have to decide either going to Disney land or Disney sea. I think Disney land is the the first target, as it represents the traditional idea. Please do Not miss any of the shows, around 3 shows / day. The evening show "" Electric parade "" is a dream show, a Must sea.   Happy day -for all ages- will be - always - a lovely memory.     Enojy."
